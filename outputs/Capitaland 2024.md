## Share Plans - Performance Share Plans and Restricted Share Plans (continued)

## Share Plans of CapitaLand Investment Limited (CLI)

The ERCC of CLI has been designated as the Committee responsible for the administration of the Share Plans.

The CLI Performance Share Plan 2021 (CLI PSP 2021) and CLI Restricted Share Plan 2021 (CLI RSP 2021) were approved by CL, the immediate holding company of CLI on 17 July 2021. The duration of each share plan is ten years commencing on 1 September 2021.

The ERCC of CLI has instituted a set of share ownership guidelines  for members  of senior management who receive shares under the CLI Performance Share Plans and CLI Restricted Share Plans.  Under these guidelines, members of senior management are required to retain a portion of the total number of CLI shares received under the aforementioned share plans, which will vary according to their respective job grade and salary.

The total number of new shares which may be allotted, issued and/or delivered pursuant to awards granted  under  the  share  plans  on  any  date,  when  aggregated  with  existing  shares  (including treasury shares and cash equivalents) delivered and/or to be delivered, pursuant to the CLI Share Plans and all shares, options or awards granted under any other share schemes of CLI then in force, shall not exceed 8% of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares) from time to time.

Details of awards granted under each CLI Share Plan are provided in the following sections:

## (a) Awards under the CLI Performance Share Plan (CLI PSP)

Under the CLI PSP, the awards granted are conditional on performance targets set based on medium-term corporate objectives.  Awards represent the right of a participant to receive fully paid shares, their equivalent cash value or combinations thereof, free of charge, upon CLI Group achieving prescribed performance target(s).

The ERCC of CLI grants an initial number of shares (baseline award) which are conditional on targets set for a performance period, currently prescribed to be a three-year performance period.  A specified number of shares will only be released by the ERCC of CLI to the recipients at the end of the qualifying performance period, provided the threshold targets are achieved.  The final number of shares to be released will depend on the achievement of predetermined targets over a three-year performance period.  No share will be released if the threshold targets are not met at the end of the performance period.  On the other hand, if superior  targets  are  met,  more  shares  than  the  baseline  award  can  be  delivered  up  to  a maximum of 300% of the baseline award.  The ERCC of CLI has the discretion to adjust the number  of  shares  released  taking  into  consideration  other  relevant  quantitative  and qualitative factors.  Recipients can receive fully paid shares delivered in a combination of 75% in ordinary shares and 25% in their equivalent cash value, at no cost.

Directors' statement

## Share Plans - Performance Share Plans and Restricted Share Plans (continued)

## Share Plans of CapitaLand Investment Limited (CLI) (continued)

## (b) Special CLI Founders Performance Share Plan Award (Special PSP) (continued)

The ERCC of CLI grants an initial number of shares (baseline award) which are conditional on the target of the CLI's share price expressed as a multiple of the CLI Group's net asset value per share (Price/NAV) set for a five-year performance period.  A specified number of shares will only be released by the ERCC of CLI to the recipients at the end of the qualifying performance period, provided the pre-specified minimum target is achieved.  No share will be released if the minimum target is not met at the end of the performance period.  On the other hand, if the superior target is met, more shares than the baseline award can be delivered up to a maximum of 300% of the baseline award.  In the event of early achievement of the targets within the first three years of the performance period, a maximum of 20% to 50% of the baseline award can be released after the third year (Interim Vesting). After the end of the five-year performance period, the final number of shares based on the final achievement factor, less any shares released as part of the Interim Vesting, will be released after the fifth year.  The ERCC of CLI has the discretion to adjust the number of shares released taking into consideration other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.  Recipients can receive fully paid shares, their equivalent cash value or combinations thereof, at no cost.

As a hiring strategy, such one-time special contingent award may (at the discretion of the ERCC of CLI) also be extended to key executives joining the CLI Group, its immediate holding company and its related corporations on a date after 1 October 2021 but not later than 19 September 2022.

As the performance conditions for an Interim Vesting have been satisfied, the ERCC of CLI has  approved  the  released  of  a  percentage  of  the  baseline  contingent  award  to  the participants.

Details of the movement in the baseline awards of CLI during the year were as follows:

Directors' statement

Year ended 31 December 2024

## Share Plans - Performance Share Plans and Restricted Share Plans (continued)

## Share Plans of CapitaLand Investment Limited (CLI) (continued)

## (c) Awards under the CLI Restricted Share Plans (CLI RSP)

Under the CLI RSP, awards granted to eligible participants vest only after the satisfactory completion of time-based service conditions or where the award is performance-related, after a further period of service beyond the performance target completion date (performancebased restricted awards).  In addition, the plans also enable grants of fully paid shares to be made to non-executive directors as part of their remuneration in respect of their office as such in lieu of cash.

Time-based RSP awards were granted in 2024 to selected senior management as part of their remuneration package.  The shares were granted pursuant to the CLI RSP and shall vest over two or three years, subject to service conditions.  Participants will receive fully paid shares, their equivalent cash value or combinations thereof, at no cost.

With effect from 2023, the RSP awards have been incorporated into the annual performance bonus where a part of the bonus declared is delivered in the form of deferred shares.  Such deferred shares will be granted to eligible employees after the end of the financial year under review pursuant to the CLI RSP.  One-third of the award will vest as soon as practicable, and the remaining two-thirds of the award will vest over the following two years in equal annual tranches, subject to service conditions.  Participants can receive fully paid shares, their equivalent cash value or combinations thereof, at no cost.

Details of the movement in the awards of CLI during the year were as follows:

## Independent auditors' report

To the Member of CapitaLand Group Pte. Ltd.

## Report on the audit of the financial statements

## Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of CapitaLand Group Pte. Ltd. (the Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet of the Group and the balance  sheet  of  the  Company  as  at  31  December  2024,  the  consolidated  income  statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information, as set out on pages FS1 to FS124.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group and the balance sheet of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the Act), Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)) and IFRS Accounting  Standards  as  issued  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (IFRS Accounting Standards) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2024 and the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group for the year ended on that date.

## Basis for opinion

We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  Singapore  Standards  on  Auditing  (SSAs).    Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.  We are independent of the Group in accordance  with  the  Accounting  and  Corporate  Regulatory  Authority Code  of  Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Other information

Management  is  responsible  for  the  other  information  contained  in  the  annual  report.    Other information is defined as all information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon.

We have obtained all other information prior to the date of this auditors' report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

- If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act, SFRS(I) and IFRS Accounting Standards, and for  devising  and  maintaining  a  system  of  internal  accounting  controls  sufficient  to  provide  a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  SSAs  will  always  detect  a  material misstatement  when  it  exists.   Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.  We also:

- · Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

<!-- image -->

- · Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls.
- · Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- · Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of  management's  use  of  the  going  concern  basis  of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the  Group's  ability  to continue  as  a  going  concern.    If  we  conclude  that  a  material  uncertainty  exists,  we  are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- · Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- · Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business  units within the group as a basis for forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit.  We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of  the  audit  and  significant  audit  findings,  including  any  significant  deficiencies  in  internal controls that we identify during our audit.

## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

## Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (continued) Year ended 31 December 2024

## Significant non-cash transactions

In  2024,  the  Group  participated  in  the  distribution  reinvestment  plans  (DRP)  of  CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust and CapitaLand China Trust to receive units in lieu of cash in respect of their distribution for the period from 1 July 2023 to 31 December 2023. The total value of the Group's participation in the above DRP amounted to $95 million.

In May 2023, the Company completed a distribution in specie of 291,982,358 stapled securities in  CapitaLand  Ascott  Trust  (CLAS)  to  its  shareholders  based  on  0.057013  CLAS  stapled securities per ordinary share.  Based on the closing market price of CLAS stapled securities on 11 May 2023 of $1.07, the distribution in specie amounted to $312 million.

## 2 Material Accounting Policies

## 2.1 Basis of preparation

## (a) Statement of compliance

The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Singapore  Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)) and IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS Accounting Standards).  SFRS(I) are issued by the  Accounting  Standards  Committee  and  comprise  standards  and  interpretations  that  are equivalent  to  IFRS  Accounting  Standards.    All  references  to  SFRS(I)  and  IFRS  Accounting Standards are subsequently referred to as SFRS(I) in these financial statements unless otherwise stated.

## (b) Basis of measurement

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.

## (c) Functional and presentation currency

These financial statements are presented in Singapore Dollars, which is the Company's functional currency.  All financial information presented in Singapore Dollars have been rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise stated.

## (d) Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with SFRS(I) requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the future including climate-related risks and opportunities, that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are consistent with the Group's risk management and climate-related commitments where appropriate.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

Information  about  critical  judgements  in  applying  accounting  policies  that  have  the  most significant  effect  on  the  amount  recognised  in  the  financial  statements  are  described  in  the following notes:

Note 6

consolidation; whether the Group has control over an investee

Note 9

recognition of deferred tax assets

Note 2.2(a), Note 32

accounting for acquisitions as business combinations or asset acquisitions

Information  about  assumptions  and  estimation  uncertainties  that  have  a  significant  risk  of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year are included in the following notes:

Note 4

measurement of recoverable amounts of goodwill

Note 5, Note 34

determination of fair value of investment properties

Note 11

determination  of  the  net  realisable  values  of  completed  units  and properties under development

Note 32

determination  of  fair  value  of  assets,  liabilities  and  contingent liabilities acquired in business combinations

Note 34

determination of fair value of financial instruments

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently by the Group entities to all periods presented in these financial statements, except as explained in note 39 which address changes in accounting policies.

## 2.2 Basis of consolidation

## (a) Business combinations and property acquisitions

The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when the acquired set  of  activities  and  assets  meets  the  definition  of  a  business  and  control  is  transferred  to  the Group.  In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets or acquisition of a property is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.

The Group has an option to apply a 'concentration test' that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business.  The optional concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.

Goodwill arising from business combinations are measured as described in note 2.5(a).

The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.  Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.

Any  contingent  consideration  payable  is  recognised  at  fair  value  at  the  acquisition  date  and included in the consideration transferred.  If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity.  Otherwise, other contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.

Costs  related  to  the  acquisition,  other  than  those  associated  with  the  issue  of  debt  or  equity securities,  that  the  Group  incurs  in  connection  with  a  business  combination  are  expensed  as incurred.

Non-controlling  interests  that  are  present  ownership  interests  and  entitle  their  holders  to  a proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets in the event of liquidation are measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets, at the acquisition date.  The measurement basis taken is elected on  a  transaction-by-transaction  basis.  All  other  non-controlling  interests  are  measured  at acquisition  date  fair  value,  unless  another  measurement  basis  is  required  by  SFRS(I).  If  the business combination is achieved in stages, the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at each acquisition date and any changes are taken to profit or loss.

When acquisition of an asset or a group of assets does not constitute a business combination, it is treated  as  property  acquisition.    In  such  cases,  the  individual  identifiable  assets  acquired  and liabilities assumed are recognised.  The acquisition cost is allocated to the individual identifiable assets and liabilities on the basis of their relative fair values at the date of acquisition.  Such a transaction does not give rise to goodwill.

## (b) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the entity.  The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date  that  control  ceases.  The  accounting  policies  of  subsidiaries  have  been  changed  when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.  Losses applicable to the noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

Changes in the Group's interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as transactions with owners and therefore no adjustments are made to goodwill and no gain or loss  is  recognised  in  profit  or  loss.    Adjustments  to  non-controlling  interests  arising  from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.

Upon the loss of control of a subsidiary, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary,  any  non-controlling  interests  and  the  other  components  of  equity  related  to  the subsidiary.  Any surplus or deficit arising from the loss of control is recognised in profit or loss. If the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost.  Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee  or  as  a  financial  asset  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  depending  on  the  level  of influence retained.

## (c) Associates and joint ventures

Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over their financial and operating policies of these entities.  Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds 20% or more of the voting power of another entity.  Joint ventures are entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.

Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (collectively referred to as 'equity-accounted investees') and are recognised initially at cost which includes transaction costs.    The  Group's  investments in  equity-accounted investees  include  goodwill  identified  on acquisition,  net  of  any  accumulated impairment  losses.   Subsequent  to  initial  recognition, the consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  Group's  share  of  the  profit  or  loss  and  other comprehensive  income  of  the  equity-accounted  investees,  after  adjustments  to  align  the accounting policies of the equity-accounted investees with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases. Dividends received reduce the carrying amount of investment.

When the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of the investment, together with any long-term interests that form part thereof, is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to fund the investee's operation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.

An impairment loss in respect  of  an  associate  or  joint  venture  is  measured  by  comparing  the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount in accordance with note 2.11.  An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.  An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

## (d) Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.  Unrealised gains  arising  from  transactions  with  equity-accounted  investees  are  eliminated  against  the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee.  Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

## (e) Acquisition under common control

Business combinations arising from transfers of interest in entities that are under common control are accounted for as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented or, if later, at the date that common control was established.  For this purpose, comparatives  are  restated.  The  assets  and  liabilities  acquired  are  recognised  at  the  carrying amounts recognised previously in the consolidated financial statements of the Group's controlling shareholder. The components of equity of the acquired entities are added to the same components within the Group equity and any gain/loss arising is recognised directly in equity as reserve on consolidation.

## 2.3 Foreign currencies

## Foreign currency transactions

Items included in the financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency that best reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances relevant to that entity (the functional currency).

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of the Group's  entities  at  the  exchange  rates  at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.    Monetary  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the end of the reporting date are translated to the functional  currency  at  the  exchange  rate  prevailing  at  that  date.    Non-monetary  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date on which the fair value was determined.  Nonmonetary items in a foreign currency that are measured in terms of historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Foreign currency differences arising from translation are recognised in profit or loss, except for differences  arising  from  the  translation  of  monetary  items  that  in  substance  form  part  of  the Group's  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation,  financial  assets  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income, financial liabilities designated as hedges of net investment in a foreign operation (note 2.8) or qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent such hedges are effective, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.

## Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions, are translated to Singapore Dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the end of  the  reporting  period.    The  income  and  expenses  of  foreign  operations  are  translated  to Singapore Dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.

Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the foreign  currency  translation  reserve  (translation  reserve)  in  equity.    However,  if  the  foreign operation  is  not  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  then  the  relevant  proportionate  share  of  the translation difference is allocated to the non-controlling interests.  When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is transferred to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.  When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests.  When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or a joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant  influence  or  joint  control,  the  relevant  proportion  of  the  cumulative  amount  is transferred to profit or loss.

## Net investment in a foreign operation

When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation  is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation.    These  are  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  are  presented  in  the translation reserve in equity.

## 2.4 Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and  equipment  are  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and accumulated impairment losses.   Cost  includes  expenditure  that  is  directly  attributable  to  the acquisition of the asset.  Certain of the Group's property, plant and equipment acquired through interests in subsidiaries, are accounted for as acquisition of assets (note 2.2(a)).

Subsequent  expenditure  relating  to  property,  plant  and  equipment  that  has  already  been recognised is added to the carrying amount of the asset if it is probable that future economic benefits, in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset, will flow  to  the  Group  and  its  cost  can  be  measured  reliably.  All  other  subsequent  expenditure  is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

Depreciation is recognised from the date that the property, plant and equipment are installed and are  ready  for  use.  Freehold  land  has  unlimited  useful  life  and  therefore  is  not  depreciated. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis  over  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  each  component  of  an  item  of  property,  plant  and equipment as follows:

Leasehold land and buildings

1 to 50 years

Plant, machinery and improvements

1 to 20 years

Motor vehicles

5 to 6 years

Furniture, fittings and equipment

1 to 10 years

Assets under construction are stated at cost and are not depreciated.  Expenditure relating to assets under construction (including borrowing costs) are capitalised when incurred.  Depreciation will commence when the development is completed and ready to use.

The assets' residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed at each reporting date, and adjusted if appropriate.

## 2.5 Intangible assets

## (a) Goodwill

For business combinations, the Group measures goodwill as at acquisition date based on the fair value of the consideration transferred (including the fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree) and the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  When the amount is negative, a gain on bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

Goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.  Goodwill arising from the acquisition of associates and joint ventures is presented together with interests in associates and joint ventures.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as described in note 2.11.

## (b) Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets with finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.  These are amortised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of one to eighteen years, from the date on which the assets are available for use.

Other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised and are measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

## 2.6 Investment properties and investment properties under development

Investment properties are properties held either to earn rental or for capital appreciation or both. Investment properties under development are properties being constructed or developed for future use  as  investment  properties.  Certain  of  the  Group's  investment  properties  acquired  through interests in subsidiaries, are accounted for as acquisition of assets (note 2.2(a)).

Investment properties and investment properties under development are initially recognised at cost,  including  transaction  costs,  and  subsequently  at  fair  value  with  any  change  therein recognised in profit or loss. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property. The cost of self-constructed investment property includes the cost of materials  and  direct  labour,  any  other  costs  directly  attributable  to  bringing  the  investment property to a working condition for their intended use and capitalised borrowing costs.  The fair value is determined  based  on  internal valuation or independent  professional valuation. Independent valuation is also carried out on occurrence of acquisition.

When  an  investment  property  or  investment  property  under  development  is  disposed  of,  the resulting  gain  or  loss  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  is  the  difference  between  the  net  disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the property.

Transfers to, or from, investment properties are made where there is a change in intent and use of the investment properties.

## 2.7 Non-current assets and liabilities held for sale

Non-current assets and liabilities, that are highly probable to be recovered primarily through sale rather  than  through  continuing  use,  are  classified  as  held  for  sale.    Immediately  before classification  as  held  for  sale,  the  assets  are  remeasured  in  accordance  with  the  applicable SFRS(I).  Thereafter, the assets are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair  value  less  costs  to  sell.    Impairment  losses  on  initial  classification  as  held  for  sale  and subsequent gains  or  losses  on  remeasurement  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss.   Gains  are  not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.

Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment classified as held for sale are not amortised or depreciated.  In addition, equity accounting of associates and joint ventures ceases once the investments are classified as held for sale.

## 2.8 Financial instruments

## (a) Non-derivative financial assets

## Classification and measurement

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

- · amortised cost;
- · fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI); and
- · fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).

The classification depends on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets as well as the contractual terms of the cash flows of the financial assets.

Financial  assets  with  embedded  derivatives  are  considered  in their  entirety  when  determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.

The Group generally classifies equity investments at FVTPL when the underlying assets held by the equity investments relate to the Group's core businesses.

For other equity investments, an irrevocable election at initial recognition may be made for the equity investments that would otherwise be measured at FVTPL to present subsequent changes in FVOCI.

The Group reclassifies financial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

## At initial recognition

A financial asset is recognised if the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial asset.

At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.  Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.

## At subsequent measurement

## (i) Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial  assets that  are  held  for  collection  of  contractual  cash  flows  where  those  cash  flows represent  solely  payments  of  principal  and  interest  are  measured  at  amortised  cost.    Interest income from these financial assets is included in interest income using the effective interest rate method.

## (ii) Financial assets at FVOCI

The Group has elected to recognise changes in fair value of equity securities, where the underlying assets held by the equity investments are non-core to the Group's  business, in other comprehensive income (OCI) as these are strategic investments and the Group considers this to be  more  relevant.    Movements  in  fair  values  of  equity  investments  classified  as  FVOCI  are presented as 'fair value gains/losses' in OCI.  Dividends from equity investments are recognised in profit or loss as dividend income. On disposal of an equity investment, any difference between the carrying amount and sales proceed amount would be recognised in OCI and transferred to revenue reserves along with the amount previously recognised in OCI relating to that asset.

## (iii) Financial assets at FVTPL

Financial  assets  that  are  held  for  trading  as  well  as  those  that  do  not  meet  the  criteria  for classification as amortised cost or FVOCI are classified as FVTPL.  Movement in fair values and interest income is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it arises and presented in 'other operating income' or 'other operating expense'.

## (b) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and bank deposits.  For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, pledged deposits are excluded whilst bank overdrafts that are repayable on  demand  and  form  an  integral  part  of  the  Group's  cash  management  are  included  as  a component of cash and cash equivalents.

## (c) Non-derivative financial liabilities

The Group initially recognises debt securities issued on the date that they are originated.  Financial liabilities for contingent consideration payable in a business combination are recognised at the acquisition  date.    All  other  financial  liabilities  (including  liabilities  designated  at  fair  value through profit or loss) are recognised initially on the trade date, which is the date that the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial liability is classified as fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held for trading or is designated as such on initial recognition.  Directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.  Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and changes therein, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss.

The  Group  classifies  non-derivative  financial  liabilities  under  the  other  financial  liabilities category.    Such  financial  liabilities  are  recognised  initially  at  fair  value  plus  any  directly attributable  transaction  costs.    Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  these  financial  liabilities  are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.  Other financial liabilities comprise loans, borrowings, debt securities and trade and other payables.

## (d) Derecognition

Financial assets are derecognised if the Group's contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial  assets  expire  or  if  the  Group  transfers  the  financial  assets  to  another  party  without retaining control or transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of the assets.  The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.

## (e) Offsetting

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the Group has a current, legally enforceable right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

## (f) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting

The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk  exposures.  Embedded  derivatives  are  separated  from  the  host  contract  and  accounted  for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative, and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.  The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.  The Group designates each hedge as either (a) cash flow hedge or (b) net investment hedge. The Group has not designated any hedge as a fair value hedge.

On initial designation of the derivative as the hedging instrument, the Group formally documents the economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, including the risk management objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction and the hedged risk, together with the methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged items attributable to the hedged risk.  For a cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction, the transaction should be highly probable to occur  and  should present  an  exposure  to  variations  in  cash  flows that  could  ultimately  affect reported profit or loss.

Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.  Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described below.

## Cash flow hedges

The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows  associated  with  highly  probable  forecast  transactions  arising  from  changes  in  foreign exchange rates and interest rates.

When  a  derivative  is  designated  as  a  cash  flow  hedging  instrument,  the  effective  portion  of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in OCI and accumulated in the hedging reserve.    Any  ineffective  portion  of  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  derivative  is  recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Where the hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, such as inventory, the amounts recognised as OCI is included in the initial cost of the nonfinancial item.

If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. When hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in the hedging reserve remains in equity until, for a hedge of a transaction resulting in recognition of a non-financial item, it is included in the non-financial item's cost on its initial recognition or, for other cash flow hedges, it is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods as the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.

## Net investment hedges

The  Group  designates  certain  derivatives  and  non-derivative  financial  liabilities  as  hedges  of foreign exchange risk on a net investment in a foreign operation.

When a derivative instrument or a non-derivative financial liability is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of, for a derivative, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument or, for a non-derivative, foreign exchange gains and losses is recognised in OCI and presented in the translation reserve within equity.    Any  ineffective  portion  of  the  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  derivative  or  foreign exchange gains and losses on the non-derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss.  The amount recognised in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation.

## Separable embedded derivatives

Derivatives may be embedded in another contractual arrangement (a host contract). The Group accounts for an embedded derivative separately from the host contract when:

- · the host contract is not an asset in the scope of SFRS(I) 9;
- · the host contract is not itself carried at FVTPL;
- · the terms of the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative if they were contained in a separate contract; and
- · the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract.

Changes in the fair value of separated embedded derivatives are recognised immediately in  profit or loss.

## (g) Sustainability-linked loans

The  Group  borrows  loans  with  contractual  cash  flows  based  on  the  Group  meeting  several sustainability performance targets.  The Group has determined that the variability in cash flows linked to the Group's sustainability performance targets is a non-financial variable specific to the parties  to  the  contract,  and  therefore,  in  accordance  with  the  Group's  accounting  policy,  the feature fails the definition of a derivative.  Accordingly, the feature is not separated.  Instead, it is included in the calculation of the effective interest of the loans.

## (h) Perpetual securities

The perpetual securities do not have a maturity date and distribution payment is optional at the discretion of the Group.  As the Group does not have a contractual obligation to repay the principal nor make any distributions, perpetual securities are classified as a separate class of equity.

Any  distributions  made  are  directly  debited  from  total  equity.    Incremental  costs  directly attributable to the issue of the perpetual securities are deducted against the proceeds from the issue.

## (i) Financial guarantees

The Group accounts for financial guarantee contracts as financial liabilities. Financial guarantees are financial instruments issued by the Group that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for the loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to meet payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.

Financial guarantees issued are initially measured at fair value.  Subsequently, they are measured at  the  higher  of  the  loss  allowance  determined  in  accordance  with  SFRS(I)  9 Financial Instruments and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of SFRS(I) 15 Revenue from Contract with Customers .

Expected credit  losses  (ECLs)  are  a  probability-weighted  estimate  of  credit  losses.  ECLs  are measured for financial guarantees issued as the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Group expects to recover.

Liabilities arising from financial guarantees are included within borrowings.

## (j) Impairment of financial assets

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the ECL associated with its financial assets carried at  amortised  cost  and  FVOCI,  contract  assets  and  financial  guarantee  contracts.  For  trade receivables,  lease  receivables  and  contract  assets,  the  Group  applies  the  simplified  approach permitted by the SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments , which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.  The Group applies the general approach of  12-month  ECL  at  initial  recognition  for  all  other  financial  assets  and  financial  guarantee contracts.

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit-impaired.    A  financial  asset  is  credit-impaired  when  one  or  more  events  that  have  a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- · significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- · a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;
- · the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;
- · it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- · the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

## Presentation of allowance for ECLs in the statement of financial position

Loss  allowance  for  financial  assets  measured  at  amortised  cost  are  deducted  from  the  gross carrying amount of these assets.

Loss allowance for financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability to the extent that they exceed the initial carrying amount of the financial guarantee contracts less the cumulated income recognised.

## Write-off

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery.  This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off.  However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due.

## 2.9 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity.

## 2.10 Development properties for sale and stocks

Development properties are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs to be incurred in selling the property.  The write-down to net realisable value is presented as allowance for foreseeable losses.

The cost of development properties comprises specifically identified costs, including acquisition costs, development expenditure, borrowing costs and other related expenditure.

When  the  development  properties  for  sale  are  being  transferred  to  investment  property,  any difference between the fair value of the property and its previous carrying amount at the date of transfer is recognised in profit or loss.

## 2.11 Impairment of non-financial assets

The  carrying  amounts  of  the  Group's  non-financial  assets,  other  than  investment  properties, development properties for sale and stocks and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.  If any such indication exists, the assets' recoverable amounts are estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful  lives,  the  recoverable  amount  is  estimated  at  each  reporting  date,  and  as  and  when indicators of impairment are identified. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.  For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGU.  Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.  Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGU that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.  Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indication that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.  An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.  An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have  been  determined,  net  of  depreciation  or  amortisation,  if  no  impairment  loss  had  been recognised.

Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate or a joint venture is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately.  Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an associate or a joint venture is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate or a joint venture may be impaired.

## 2.12 Employee benefits

All short-term employee benefits, including accumulated compensated absences, are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recognised in the period in which the employees render their services.

The Group's obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.  That benefit is discounted to determine its present value.

A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Defined contribution plans

Contributions to post-employment benefits under defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in profit or loss in the period during which the related services are rendered by employees.

## Share-based payments

For  equity-settled  share-based  payment  transactions,  the  fair  value  of  the  services  received  is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the equity instrument.  The fair value of the services received is determined by reference to the fair value of the equity instrument granted at the grant date. At each reporting date, the number of equity instruments that are expected to be vested are estimated.  The impact on the revision of original estimates is recognised as an expense and as a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period, unless the revision to original estimates is due to market conditions.  No adjustment is made if the revision or actual outcome differs from the original estimate due to market conditions.  The Group recognises the effect of modification that increase the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement. The incremental fair value granted is included in the measurement of the amount recognised for services received over the period from modification date until the date when the modified equitysettled share-based payments transactions vest.

For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the fair value of the goods or services received is  recognised  as  an  expense  with  a  corresponding increase  in  liability.   The  fair  value  of  the services received is determined by reference to the fair value of the liability.  Until the liability is settled,  the  fair  value  of  the  liability  is  re-measured  at  each  reporting  date  and  at  the  date  of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the period.

## 2.13 Provision

A  provision  is  recognised  if,  as  a  result  of  a  past  event,  the  Group  has  a  present  legal  or constructive  obligation  that  can  be  estimated  reliably,  and  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the  present  obligation  at  the  reporting  date,  taking  into  account  the  risks  and  uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows when the effect of the time value of money is material.

When some or  all  of  the  economic  benefits  required  to  settle  a  provision  are  expected  to  be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

## 2.14 Leases

## As a lessee

At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices.  However, for the leases of property, the Group has elected not to separate non-lease  components  and  account  for  the  lease  and  non-lease  components  as  a  single  lease component.

The Group recognises a right-of-use assets and a lease liability at the lease commitment date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability  adjusted  for  any  lease  payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or  to  restore  the  underlying  asset  or  the  site  on  which  it  is  located,  less  any  lease  incentives received.

The  right-of-use  assets  is  subsequently  depreciated  using  the  straight-line  method  from  the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers  ownership  of  the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use assets reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option.  In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, except for right-of-use assets that meet the definition of investment property carried at fair value in accordance with note 2.6.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate.

The  lease  liability  is  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method.    It  is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual  value  guarantee,  if  the  Group  changes  its  assessment  of  whether  it  will  exercise  a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

The Group presents the right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in 'property, plant and equipment' and lease liabilities in 'borrowings' in the balance sheet.

## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of lowvalue assets and short-term leases, including office equipment.  The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

## As a lessor

To classify  each  lease,  the  Group  makes  an  overall  assessment  of  whether  the  lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset.  If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease.  As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

The Group leases out its investment property, including own property and right-of-use assets. The Group has classified these leases as operating leases.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately.  It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the rightof-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset.  If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

The Group recognises lease payments received from investment property under operating leases as rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term as part of 'revenue'. Rental income from sub-leased property is recognised as 'other income'.

## 2.15 Revenue recognition

## Rental income

Rental income receivable under operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, except where an alternative basis is more representative of the pattern of benefits to be derived from the leased asset.  Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the  total  rental  income  to  be  received.    Contingent  rentals  are  recognised  as  income  in  the accounting period in which they are earned.

## Development properties for sale

The Group develops and sells residential  projects to customers  through  fixed-price  contracts. Revenue is recognised when the control over the residential project has been transferred to the customer.  At contract inception, the Group assesses whether the Group transfers control of the residential project over time or at a point in time by determining if (a) its performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group; and (b) the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.

The residential projects have no alternative use for the Group due to contractual restriction, and the  Group  has  enforceable  rights  to  payment  arising  from  the  contractual  terms.    For  these contracts,  revenue  is  recognised  over  time  by  reference  to  the  Group's  progress  towards completing the construction of the residential project.  The measure of progress is determined based on the proportion of contract costs incurred to date to the estimated total contract costs. Costs incurred that are not related to the contract or that do not contribute towards satisfying a performance obligation are excluded from the measure of progress and instead are expensed as incurred.

For certain contracts where the Group does not have enforceable right to payment, revenue is recognised  only  when the  completed  residential project  is  delivered  to  the  customers  and the customers have accepted it in accordance with the sales contract.

Under certain payment schemes, the time when payments are made by the buyer and the transfer of control of the property to the buyer do not coincide and where the difference between the timing of receipt of the payments and the satisfaction of a performance obligation is 12 months or more, the entity adjusts the transaction price with its customer and recognises a financing component. In adjusting for the financing component, the entity uses a discount rate that would reflect that of a  separate  financing  transaction  between  the  entity  and  its  customer  at  contract  inception.    A finance income or finance expense will be recognised depending on the arrangement.  The Group has elected to apply the practical expedient not to adjust the transaction price for the existence of significant  financing  component  when  the  period  between  the  transfer  of  control  of  good  or service to a customer and the payment date is 12 months or less.

Revenue is measured at the transaction price agreed under the contract. Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change.  Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in the profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known by management.

The customer is invoiced on a payment schedule and are typically triggered upon achievement of specified construction milestones.  If the value of the goods transferred by the Group exceed the payments,  a  contract  asset  is  recognised.    If  the  payments  exceed  the  value  of  the  goods transferred, a contract liability is recognised.

For costs incurred in fulfilling the contract, the Group will capitalise these as contract costs assets only if (a) these costs relate directly to a contract or an anticipated contract which the Group can specifically identify; (b) these costs generate or enhance resources of the Group that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future; and (c) these costs are expected to be recovered.  Otherwise, such costs are recognised as an expense immediately.

Capitalised  contract  costs  are  subsequently  amortised  on  a  systematic  basis  as  the  Group recognises the related revenue over time.  An impairment loss is recognised in the profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of capitalised contract costs exceeds the expected remaining consideration less any directly related costs not yet recognised as expenses.

## Fee income

Fee  income  from  provision  of  fund  and  asset  management,  commercial  management,  project management, lodging management and administrative and support service is recognised as the services are provided.

The  Group  also  earns  performance  fees  from  the  provision  of  fund  management  services. Performance fees are for performance obligations fulfilled over time and for which consideration is variable.  The fees for each applicable fund are determined in accordance with the relevant agreement which stipulates out-performance of a benchmark over a given period.  Performance fee  revenue  is  recognised  to  the  extent  that  it  is  highly  probable  that  the  amount  of  variable consideration recognised will not be significantly reversed when the uncertainty is resolved.

## 2.16 Finance income and finance costs

The  Group's  finance  income  and  finance  costs  mainly  comprise  interest  income  and  interest expense.  Interest income or expense is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.

Effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:

- · the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or
- · the amortised cost of the financial liability.

Interest expense that is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset which necessarily takes a substantial period of time to be prepared for its intended use or sale, is capitalised.

## 2.17 Tax

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax, as well as land appreciation tax in China. Income tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.  The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.

Deferred tax is not recognised for:

- · temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
- · temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to the  extent  that  the  Group  is  able  to  control  the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the  temporary difference and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- · taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

The measurement of deferred taxes reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be utilised.  Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the impact of  uncertain  tax  positions  and  whether  additional  taxes  and  interest  may  be  due.    The  Group believes  that  its  accruals  for  tax  liabilities  are  adequate  for  all  open  tax  years  based  on  its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience.

This  assessment  relies  on  estimates  and  assumptions and  may  involve  a  series  of  judgements about future events.  New information may become available that causes the Group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.

Land appreciation tax in China relates to the tax on gains arising from the transfer of land use right and the buildings that are constructed on the land.  Land appreciation tax is levied at 30% to 60% on gain from sale of landed properties with reference to the percentage of appreciated value over the deductible expenditure.

## Global minimum top-up tax

The Group has determined that the global minimum top-up tax - which it is required to pay under Pillar Two legislation - is an income tax in the scope of SFRS(I) 1-12 Income Taxes . The Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the topup tax and accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred. Accordingly, the Group neither recognises nor discloses information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.

Notes to the financial statements

- (a) As at 31 December 2024, the carrying amounts of land and buildings comprise freehold land and buildings of $nil million (2023: $456 million) and leasehold land and buildings of $85 million (2023: $404 million).
- (b) The  classification  of  lodging  properties  as  property,  plant  and  equipment  or  investment property is based on the level of ancillary services and the length of stay, amongst other factors. In 2023, the Group evaluated and reclassified a lodging property in Ireland from investment properties (note 5) with the plan to renovate, rebrand and operate as it as a full facility  hotel.  The  Group  also  reclassified  three  lodging  properties  in  Singapore  and Australia to assets held for sale (note 15).

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on value in use calculations. The value in use calculation is a discounted cash flow model using cash flow projections based on the most recent forecasts approved by management covering three to ten years. The  discounted  cash  flow  models  also  took  into  account  the  probability  of  changes  to cashflow projection. Cash flows beyond these periods are extrapolated using the estimated terminal growth rates stated in the table above. The discount rates applied are the weighted average cost of capital from the relevant business segments. The key assumptions are those relating  to  expected  changes  in  average  rental,  occupancy  rates,  direct  costs  and  market volatility affecting weighted average cost of capital.  The terminal growth rates used for each CGU are based on management's expectation of the long-term average growth rates of the respective industries and countries in which the CGUs operate. Management has assessed that the recoverable amount to be higher than its carrying amount.

## ASB

The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.  The value in use calculation is a discounted cash flow model using cash flow projections based on  the  most  recent  forecasts  approved  by  management  covering  ten  years.  Cash  flows beyond  the  first  year  are  extrapolated  using  the  estimated  terminal  growth  rate  of  1.0% (2023: 1.0%).  The discount rate of 6.8% (2023: 6.9%) is applied using the weighted average cost  of  capital  from  the  relevant  business  segment.  Management  has  assessed  that  the recoverable amount to be higher than its carrying amount.

## (b) Impairment test for management contracts

These mainly relate to the management contracts entered into between subsidiary companies and CapitaLand Ascendas REIT and CapitaLand India Trust. These contracts are deemed to have indefinite useful lives and are measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined based on value in use calculations. Cash flow projections are based on forecast using discount rates of 7.1% to 10.5% (2023: 6.0% to 8.0%) and growth rate of 1.0% (2023: 1.0%) covering a ten-year period and beyond. The forecast is reviewed, updated and approved by management on an annual basis.  The Group has assessed and determined that no impairment in the value of management contracts has arisen.

(a) Investment properties, which include those in the course of development, are stated at fair value  based  on  independent  professional  valuations.  The  fair  values  are  based  on  open market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date  of  the  valuation  between  a  willing  buyer  and  a  willing  seller  in  an  arm's  length transaction wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably and without compulsion.  In determining the fair value, the valuers have used valuation techniques which involve certain estimates.  The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of investment properties include market-corroborated capitalisation rate, terminal yield rate, discount rate, comparable market price, occupancy rate and gross development costs.

The carrying amounts of the investment properties at reporting date were based on valuations performed  by  the  independent  external  valuers.  The  valuers  had  considered  valuation techniques including the direct comparison method, capitalisation approach, discounted cash flows and residual method in arriving at the open market value as at the reporting date.

Notes to the financial statements

The  direct  comparison  method  involves  the  analysis  of  comparable  sales  of  similar properties and adjusting the sale prices to that reflective of the investment properties.  The capitalisation  approach  capitalises  an  income  stream  into  a  present  value  using  revenue multipliers or single-year capitalisation rates.  The discounted cash flow method involves the estimation and projection of an income stream over a period and discounting the income stream with an internal rate of return to arrive at the market value.  In the residual method of valuation, the total gross development costs and developer's profit are deducted from the gross development value to arrive at the residual value of land.  The gross development value is the estimated value of the property assuming satisfactory completion of the development as  at  the  date  of  valuation.  Details  of  valuation  methods  and  key  assumptions  used  to estimate the fair values of investment properties are set out in note 34.

(b) The  Group's  investment  properties  which  are  classified  under  Level  3  in  the  fair  value hierarchy.

(c) As at  31  December  2024, investment  properties  valued  at  $1,093  million  (2023:  $1,530 million) were under development.

(d) As at 31 December 2024, certain investment properties with carrying value of approximately $7,517 million (2023: $12,019 million) were mortgaged to banks to secure credit facilities (notes 19 and 20).

(e) Investment properties of the Group are held mainly for use by tenants under operating leases. Minimum lease payments receivable under non-cancellable operating leases of investment properties and not recognised in the financial statements are as follows:

- (c) Determining whether the Group has control over the REITs it manages requires management judgement.  In  exercising  its  judgement,  management  considers  the  proportion  of  its ownership interest and voting rights, the REIT managers' decision making authority over the REITs as well as the Group's overall exposure to variable returns, both from the REIT managers' remuneration and their interests in the REITs.

As of 31 December 2024, the Group assesses that it controls CapitaLand Malaysia Trust (CLMT) (2023: CLMT and CapitaLand Ascott Trust (CLAS) (collectively referred to as Consolidated REITs)), although the Group owns less than half of the ownership interest and voting power of the REIT. CLAS is a stapled group comprising CapitaLand Ascott Real Estate Investment Trust and CapitaLand Ascott Business Trust. Following the sale of 4.88% stake in CLAS on 19 December 2024, the Group assessed that it has lost control in CLAS and consequently CLAS ceased to be a consolidated REIT of the Group with effect from 19 December 2024.

The  activities  of  the  consolidated  REIT  are  managed  by  the  Group's  wholly-owned subsidiary,  namely  CapitaLand  Malaysia  Mall  REIT  Management  Sdn.  Bhd.  (the  REIT Manager).  The  REIT  Manager  has  decision-making  authority  over  CLMT,  subject  to oversight by the trustee of CLMT.  The Group's overall exposure to variable returns, both from the REIT Manager's remuneration and the interest in CLMT, is significant and any decisions made by the REIT Manager affect the Group's overall exposure to variable returns.

Management  assessed  the  extent  of  its  control  over  CICT  and  CLAR,  taking  into consideration that the REITs are managed by the wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Group, the Group's effective stake in the relevant trusts and the returns (both marginal and absolute returns)  generated  from  its  investment  in  and  management  of  both  trusts.  Management concluded  that  the  Group  does  not  have  sufficient  control  over  CICT  and  CLAR  and therefore accounts for its investments in CICT and CLAR as associates.

The following summarises the financial information of the Group's material associates based on their respective consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with SFRS(I), modified for fair value adjustments on acquisition and differences in the Group's accounting policies.    The  table  also  includes  summarised  aggregate  financial  information  for  the Group's interest in other individually immaterial associates, based on the amounts reported in the Group's consolidated financial statements.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes relate to the same taxation authority.  The following amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown on the balance sheets:

As at 31 December 2024, deferred tax liabilities amounting to $11 million (2023: $13 million) had not been recognised for taxes that would be payable on the undistributed earnings of certain subsidiaries as these earnings would not be distributed in the foreseeable future.

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be utilised.  Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.  The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets in respect of the following:

|                                  | The Group   | The Group   |
|----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|

| Unutilised capital allowances    | 51          | 15          |
|                                  | 2,057       | 2,100       |

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the subsidiaries of the Group can utilise the benefits.

Temporary differences would expire in the following periods:

| Expiry period         | 2024 $'M   | 2023 $'M   |

| No expiry             | 494        | 806        |

- (d) The Group recognises revenue over time for residential projects under progressive payment scheme  in  Singapore.  The  progress  towards  completing  the  construction  is  measured  in accordance  with  the  accounting  policy  stated  in  note  2.15.  Significant  assumptions  are required in determining the stage of completion and the Group evaluates them by relying on the work of specialists.
- The Group makes allowance for foreseeable losses by applying its experience in estimating the net realisable values of completed units and properties under development.  References were  made  to  comparable  properties,  timing  of  sale  launches,  location  of  property, management's expected net selling prices and estimated development expenditure.  Market conditions may, however, change which may affect the future selling prices of the remaining unsold  units  of  the  development  properties  and  accordingly,  the  carrying  value  of development properties for sale may have to be written down in future periods.
- (e) As  at  31  December  2024,  development  properties  for  sale  amounting  to  approximately $1,829 million (2023: $2,521 million) were mortgaged to banks to secure credit facilities of the Group (note 19).

During the financial year, the following amounts were capitalised as cost of development properties for sale:

## ii) CapitaLand Development Performance Unit Plans 2022 (PUP 2022) - Cashsettled

In  2022,  the  ERNCC  of  the  Company  approved  the  CapitaLand  Development Performance Unit Plan 2022 (PUP 2022) and CapitaLand Development Restricted Unit Plan 2022 (RUP 2022) awards to eligible employees.  Under these awards, performance  targets  are  set  over  certain  performance  period  and  are  based  on operational financial performance.  The final awards will be paid in cash based on the prevailing net asset value.

The ERNCC grants an initial number of notional units (baseline award) which are conditional on targets set for a performance period, currently prescribed to be a three-year performance period.  A specified number of units will only be released by the ERNCC to the recipients at the end of the qualifying performance period, provided  the  threshold  targets  are  achieved.    The  final  number  of  units  to  be released will depend on the achievement of pre-determined targets over the threeyear performance period.  No unit will be released if the threshold targets are not met at the end of the performance period.  On the other hand, if superior targets are met, more units than the baseline award can be delivered up to a maximum of 200% of the baseline award.  The ERNCC has the discretion to adjust the number of units released  taking  into  consideration  other  relevant  quantitative  and  qualitative factors.  Recipients will receive the cash value based on the prevailing net asset value.

The performance conditions are as follows:

- (a) CapitaLand  Development  Group's  (CLD  Group)  (excluding  CLI  Group) annualised absolute total shareholder return measured as a multiple of cost of equity in 2023 to 2025 and 2024 to 2026 for the grants made in 2023 and 2024 respectively;
- (b) CLD Group's (excluding CLI Group) return on equity achieved in 2025 and 2026 for the grants made in 2023 and 2024 respectively;
- (c) Group's carbon emissions intensity reduction achieved by 2025 and 2026 for the grants made in 2023 and 2024 respectively using 2019 as a baseline; and
- (d) CLD Group's execution of  strategic  projects  for  grants  made  in  2023  and 2024.

Movements in the number of units outstanding under PUP 2022 were summarised below:

The ERNCC grants an initial number of notional units (baseline award) which are conditional on targets set for a performance period, currently prescribed to be a one-year performance period.  A specified number of units will only be released by the ERNCC to the recipients at the end of the qualifying performance period, provided  the  threshold  targets  are  achieved.

On the other hand, if superior targets are met, more units than the baseline award can be delivered up to a maximum of 150% of the baseline award.  The ERNCC has the discretion to adjust the number of units released  taking  into  consideration  other  relevant  quantitative  and  qualitative factors.  Recipients will receive the cash value based on the prevailing net asset value.

The performance conditions are as follows:

- (a) CLD Group's (excluding CLI Group) earnings before interest and taxes; and
- (b) CLD Group's (excluding CLI Group) return on equity.

Movements  in  the  number  of  units  outstanding  under  the  RUP  2022  were summarised below:

## ii) Special CLI Founders Performance Share Plan Award (Special PSP) - Equitysettled/Cash-settled

This relates to the compensation costs of CLI's Special PSP granted under CLI PSP 2021 reflecting the benefits accruing to the employees over the service period to which the performance criteria relate.

Pursuant to the CLI PSP, the Special PSP award granted to selected key executives of the CLI Group, its immediate holding company and its related corporations is conditional  on  a  performance  target  based  on  longer  term  wealth  creation objectives.  Participants will receive a specified number of shares after the end of the performance period conditional on achievement of performance conditions.

The ERCC of CLI grants an initial number of shares (baseline award) which are conditional  on  the  target  of  CLI's  share  price  expressed  as  a  multiple  of  CLI Group's  net  asset  value  per  share  (Price/NAV)  set  for  a  five-year  performance period.  A specified number of shares will only be released by the ERCC of CLI to the recipients at the end of the qualifying performance period, provided the prespecified minimum target is achieved.  No share will be released if the minimum target is not met at the end of the performance period.  On the other hand, if the superior target is met, more shares than the baseline award can be delivered up to a maximum of 300% of the baseline award.  In the event of early achievement of the targets within the first three years of the performance period, a maximum of 20% to 50% of the baseline award can be released after the third year (Interim Vesting). After the end of the five-year performance period, the final number of shares based on  the  final  achievement  factor,  less  any  shares  released  as  part  of  the  Interim Vesting, will be released after the fifth year.  The ERCC of CLI has the discretion to  adjust  the  number  of  shares  released  taking  into  consideration  other  relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. Recipients can receive fully paid shares, their equivalent cash value or combinations thereof, at no cost.

A one-time special  contingent  award  was  granted  to selected  key  executives  in CLI Group, its  immediate  holding  company  and  its  related  corporations  as  at  1 October 2021.  As a hiring strategy, such one-time special contingent award may (at the absolute discretion of the ERCC of CLI) also be extended to key executives joining CLI Group, its immediate holding company and its related corporations on a date after 1 October 2021 but not later than 19 September 2022.

As  the  performance  conditions  for  an  Interim  Vesting  have  been  satisfied,  the ERCC of CLI has approved the released of a percentage of the baseline contingent award to the participants.

Movements  in  the  number  of  shares  outstanding  under  the  Special  PSP  were summarised below:

## Capital management

The Group's policy is to build a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.  The Group monitors the return on capital, which the Group defines as total shareholders' equity, excluding non-controlling interests, perpetual securities and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.

The  Group  also  monitors  capital  using  a  net  debt-to-equity  ratio,  which  is  defined  as  net borrowings divided by total equity (including non-controlling interests and perpetual securities).

| Net debt                       |      | 11,577      | 16,061      |
| Total equity                   |      | 20,850      | 25,046      |
| Net debt-to-equity ratio       |      | 0.56        | 0.64        |

The Group seeks to strike a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher level of borrowings and the liquidity and security afforded by a sound capital position.

The Group's capital structure is regularly reviewed and managed. Adjustments are made to the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions, regulatory requirements and business strategies affecting the Company or the Group.

The  Group's  subsidiaries  in  The  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  India  are  subject  to foreign exchange rules and regulations promulgated by the PRC and India government which may impact how the Group manages capital.  In addition, seven of the Group's subsidiaries (2023: seven)  are  required  to  maintain  certain  minimum  base  capital  and  financial  resources,  or shareholders' funds as they are holders of Capital Markets Services licenses registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore or the Securities Commission Malaysia to conduct the regulated activity of Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) management.  In addition, the consolidated REIT (namely, CapitaLand Malaysia Trust) are subject to the aggregate leverage limit as defined in the Property Funds Appendix of the Code of Investment Scheme.  These subsidiaries have complied with the applicable capital requirements throughout the year.

There were no changes in the Group's approach to capital management during the year.

## 25 Perpetual Securities

The Group's perpetual securities as at 31 December 2023 were issued by its subsidiaries, CLAS and CapitaLand Treasury Limited (CTL) (collectively referred to as 'Issuers').  The perpetual securities comprised:

| Perpetual securities or notes                                                                  | Issue date       | Principal amount $'M   |

| CLAS                                                                                           |                  |                        |
| - Fixed rate perpetual securities with an initial distribution rate of 4.68% per annum         | 30 June 2015     | 250                    |
| - Fixed rate perpetual securities with an initial distribution rate of 3.88% per annum         | 4 September 2019 | 150                    |
| Issued under CTL's $5,000,000,000 Euro Medium Term Note Programme:                             |                  |                        |
| - Fixed rate subordinated perpetual notes with an initial distribution rate of 3.65% per annum | 17 October 2019  | 500                    |

- (a) The perpetual securities issued by CLAS have no fixed redemption date and redemption is at  the  option  of  the  issuer  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  issue  of  the  securities. The distribution will be payable semi-annually at the discretion of the issuer and will be noncumulative.  These perpetual securities rank pari passu with the holders of preferred units (if any) and rank ahead of the stapled security holders of the CLAS, but junior to the claims of all other present and future creditors of the CLAS.
- (b) The  perpetual  securities  or  notes  issued  by  CTL  have  no  fixed  redemption  date  and redemption is at the option of CTL in accordance to the terms and conditions of the perpetual notes. The distribution will be payable semi-annually at the discretion of CTL and will be cumulative.  The  perpetual  notes  will  constitute  direct,  unconditional,  unsecured  and subordinated  obligations of  CTL  and  shall  at  all  times  rank pari  passu and  without  any preference  among  themselves  and  with  any  parity  obligations  of  CTL.  The  perpetual securities were fully redeemed on 16 October 2024.

As the perpetual securities have no fixed maturity date and the payment of distributions is at the discretion of the Issuers, the Issuers are considered to have no contractual obligations to repay the principal or to pay any distributions, and the perpetual securities do not meet the definition for classification  as  a  financial  liability  under  SFRS(I)  1-32 Financial  Instruments:  Presentation , they are presented within equity, and distributions are treated as dividends.

As of 31 December 2024, there were no perpetual securities as the Group redeemed the perpetual notes  issued  by  CTL  in  October  2024,  and  ceased  to  consolidate  CLAS  as  a  subsidiary  in accordance with SFRS(I) 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and now accounts for it as an associate following the sale of 4.88% stake in CLAS in December 2024 (note 31).

- · advance consideration received from customers; and

|                                                                                           | The Group   | The Group   |

## Global minimum tax under Pillar Two

To address concerns about uneven profit distribution and tax contributions of large multinational corporations, various agreements have been reached at the global level, including an agreement by over 140 jurisdictions to introduce a global minimum tax rate of 15%. In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released a set of model rules, followed  by  detailed  commentary  and  administrative  guidance  in  2022  and  2024,  that  are expected to be used by individual jurisdictions that signed the agreement to amend their local tax laws.

As  of  31  December  2024,  various  jurisdictions  where  the  Group  operates  in  (e.g.  Australia, France,  Germany  (and  most  EU  jurisdictions)  and  the  UK)  have  enacted  tax  legislations  to implement the Pillar Two model rules, effective from 31 December 2023/1 January 2024.  Other jurisdictions, such as Singapore, have enacted legislation to implement Pillar Two rules which will take effect from 1 January 2025.  Japan and South Korea have also enacted legislation to implement Pillar Two rules; however, the effective date for their domestic minimum tax rules is currently unclear.

The Group has performed an assessment of the potential top-up tax impact from the enacted legislations.  As  of  31  December  2024,  the  Group  did  not  have  subsidiaries  with  significant operations in countries where the statutory tax rate is less than 15%.  Accordingly, top-up taxes, if any, did not and is not expected to have a significant impact to the Group.

## 30 Dividends

The Board of Directors of the Company has proposed a tax-exempt ordinary dividend of $0.080 per share which amounts to a payout of approximately $415 million based on the number of issued shares as at 31 December 2024.

For the financial year ended 31 December 2023, a tax-exempt ordinary dividend of $0.080 per share of $416 million were paid in 2023.

## 32 Business Combinations

At  the  time  of  each  acquisition,  the  Group  considers  whether  each  acquisition  represents  the acquisition of a business or the acquisition of an asset.  The Group accounts for an acquisition as a business combination where an integrated set of activities is acquired in addition to the property. Typically,  the  Group  assesses  the  acquisition  as  a  purchase  of  business  when  the  strategic management function and the associated processes were purchased along with the underlying properties.

There were no significant business combinations in 2024.

## 2023

## Acquisition of Quest Apartment Hotels (NZ) Limited

On  31  August  2023,  the  Group  acquired  100%  of  the  shares  and  voting  interests  in  Quest Apartment Hotels (NZ) Limited and its subsidiaries (QNZ) from unrelated parties. Following the acquisition, QNZ became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group.

QNZ is the master franchisor for Quest brand in New Zealand since 2000. The acquisition of QNZ complements the  Group's  lodging  platform,  generating  asset-light,  fee  related  earnings (FRE), through management and franchising businesses.

From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2023, QNZ contributed revenue of $3 million and net profit of $1 million to the Group's results. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023, management estimates that the contribution to the Group's revenue and net profits from QNZ would  have  been  $10  million  and  $3  million  respectively.  In  determining  this  amount, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023.

Goodwill of $15 million (see note 4) was attributed to the lodging management business acquired, which was recognised as a result of the difference between the fair value of the Group's interest in QNZ and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Total acquisition-related costs of $1 million related to stamp duties, legal, due diligence and tax advisory fees were included in administrative expenses in the current year.

## Measurement of fair value

The valuation techniques used for measuring the fair value of the material assets acquired and liabilities assumed were as follows:

| Assets acquired and liabilities assumed   | Valuation technique                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Intangible assets                         | Intangible assets mainly consist of management contracts for which independent valuation is conducted using the multi-period excess earnings method. The multi-period excess earnings method considers the present value of net cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationships, by excluding any cash flows related to contributory assets. |
| Other current assets and liabilities      | Other current assets and liabilities include trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables, and other current liabilities. The fair values of these assets and liabilities are determined to approximate the carrying amounts since they are short term in nature.                                                          |

## 33 Financial Risk Management

## (a) Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group and the Company are exposed to market risk (including interest rate, foreign currency and price risks), credit risk and liquidity risk arising from its diversified business. The Group's risk management approach seeks to minimise the potential material adverse effects  from  these  exposures.  The  Group  uses  financial  instruments  such  as  currency forwards,  interest  rate  swaps  and  cross  currency  swaps  as  well  as  foreign  currency borrowings to hedge certain financial risk exposures.

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's  risk  management  framework.   The  Board  has  established  the  Audit  and  Risk Committee (ARC) to strengthen its risk management processes and framework.  The ARC is  assisted  by  an  independent  unit  called  the  Risk  Management  (RM)  which  tracks  the various  key  risk  indicators  (KRI)  on  a  half  yearly  basis  to  update  the  committee  of  any breaches to the Group's KRI.  A group-wide Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) is conducted annually by all business units to identify key material risks, mitigating measures and any opportunities to leverage on.

## (b) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates  and  equity  prices  will  have  on  the  Group's  income  or  the  value  of  its  holdings  of financial instruments.  The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

## (i) Interest rate risk

The Group's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rate environment relates mainly to its investment in financial products and debt obligations.

The investments in financial products are short term in nature and they are not held for trading or speculative purposes.  The financial products mainly comprise fixed deposits which yield better returns than cash at bank.

The Group manages its interest rate exposure by maintaining a prudent mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings.  The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that between 60% and 70% of its interest rate risk exposure is at a fixed rate.  The Group actively reviews its debt portfolio, taking into account the investment holding period and nature of its assets. The Group also uses hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to minimise its exposure to interest rate volatility and classifies these interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps as cash flow hedges.

As at 31 December 2024, the Group has interest rate swaps classified as cash flow hedges with notional contractual amount of $4,219 million (2023: $4,893 million) and for which the Group pays fixed interest rates and receive variable rates equal to the Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA), US Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and Australia Bank Bill Swap Bid Rates (BBSY) on the notional amount.

As at 31 December 2024, the Group has cross currency interest rate swaps classified as cash  flow  hedges  with  notional  contractual  amount  of  $645  million  (2023:  $682 million) and for which the Group pays fixed interest rates (from Chinese Renminbi and Singapore  Dollars)  and  receives  variable  rates  (for  US  Dollars,  Japanese  Yen  and Singapore Dollars) on the notional amounts.

The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the reference interest rates, tenors, repricing dates and maturities and the notional or par amounts.

The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the critical terms method.  When all critical terms match, the economic relationship is considered to be 100% effective.

Hedge  ineffectiveness  may  occur  due  to  changes  in  the  critical  terms  of  either  the interest rate swaps or borrowings.

The carrying value of interest rate swaps as at 31 December 2024 was net liabilities of $7 million (2023: net assets of $18 million) comprising derivative assets of $8 million (2023: $43 million) and derivative liabilities of $15 million (2023: $26 million).

## Sensitivity analysis

For variable rate financial liabilities, it is estimated that an increase of 100 basis point in  interest  rate  at  the  reporting  date  would lead  to  a  reduction  in  the  Group's  profit before tax (and revenue reserve) by approximately $53 million (2023: $84 million). A decrease in 100 basis point in interest rate would have an equal but opposite effect. This  analysis  assumes  that  all  other  variables,  in  particular  foreign  currency  rates, remain constant, and has not taken into account the effects of qualifying borrowing costs allowed for capitalisation, the associated tax effects and share of non-controlling interests.

## (ii) Foreign currency risk

The  Group  operates  internationally  and  is  exposed  to  various  currencies,  mainly Singapore  Dollars,  Chinese  Renminbi,  Euro,  Japanese  Yen,  Malaysian  Ringgit, Australian Dollars, Sterling Pound, US Dollars and Vietnamese Dong.

The Group maintains a natural hedge, whenever possible, by borrowing in the currency of  the  country  in  which  its  property  or  investment  is  located  or  by  borrowing  in currencies that match the future revenue stream to be generated from its investments.

As  at  the  reporting  date,  the  Group  uses  certain  foreign  currency  denominated borrowings,  which  include  bank  loans  and  medium  term  notes  amounting  to  $382 million  (2023:  $647  million)  to  hedge  against  the  currency  risk  arising  from  the Group's net investments in certain subsidiaries.

The Group uses forward exchange contracts or currency swaps to hedge its foreign currency risk, where feasible. It generally enters into forward exchange contracts or currency  swaps  with  maturities  ranging  between  three  months  and  two  years.  The foreign exchange forwards and currency swaps are denominated in the same currency as  the  highly  probable  transactions,  therefore  the  economic  relationship  is  100% effective.

Hedge ineffectiveness may occur due to:

- · Changes in timing of the forecasted transaction from what was originally planned; and
- · Changes in the credit risk of the derivative counterparty or the Group.

The net carrying amount of the forward exchange and cross currency swap contracts as at 31 December 2024 was net liabilities of $4 million (2023: net assets $86 million), comprising  derivative  assets  of  $13  million  (2023:  $89  million)  and  derivative liabilities of $17 million (2023: $3 million).

Foreign exchange exposures in transactional currencies other than functional currencies of the operating entities are kept to an acceptable level.

## Sensitivity analysis

It  is  estimated  that  a  five  percentage  point  weakening  in  foreign  currencies  against  the respective functional currencies of the Group would decrease the Group's profit before tax by approximately $29 million (2023: $9 million).  A five percentage point strengthening in foreign currencies against the Singapore Dollar would have an equal but opposite effect. The Group's outstanding forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps have been included  in  this  calculation.    The  analysis  assumed  that  all  other  variables,  in  particular interest  rates,  remain  constant  and  does  not  take into account the translation related risk, associated tax effects and share of non-controlling interests.

There was no significant exposure to foreign currencies for the Company as at 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023.

## (c) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.  For trade and other receivables, contract assets and financial assets at amortised cost, the Group has guidelines governing the process of granting credit as a service or product provider in its respective segments of business. Trade and other receivables and contract assets relate mainly to the Group's customers who bought its residential units and tenants from its office buildings, shopping malls, business parks and serviced residences.  Financial assets at amortised cost relate mainly to amounts owing by related parties. Investments and financial transactions are restricted to counterparties that meet the appropriate credit criteria.

The principal risk to which the Group and the Company is exposed to in respect of financial guarantee contracts is credit risk in connection with the guarantee contracts they have issued. To mitigate the risk, management continually monitors the risk and has established processes including performing credit evaluations of the parties for whom it is providing the guarantee to.  Guarantees are only given for the benefit of its subsidiaries and related parties.  The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of these financial guarantees at the balance sheet date is disclosed in note 36.

The Group has a diversified portfolio of businesses and as at balance sheet date, there was no significant concentration of credit risk with any entity.  The maximum exposure to credit risk  is  represented  by  the  carrying  amount  of  each  financial  asset  in  the  balance  sheet, including derivative financial instruments as well as any irrevocable loan undertaking to associates and joint ventures.

## (i) Trade receivables and contract assets

The  Group  reviews  the  customers'  credit  risk  taking  into  account  the  aging  of  the outstanding receivables, amount of security deposit available as well as any indication of credit default, and assess the amount of specific allowance for doubtful receivable required for each customer.

The Group also uses a provision matrix to measure the lifetime expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables and contract assets.

Notes to the financial statements

In  measuring  the  expected  credit  losses,  trade  receivables  and  contract  assets  are grouped  based  on  similar  credit risk characteristics and  days  past due. When determining the expected credit loss rates, the Group considers historical loss rates for customer grouped by industry sector and forward-looking macroeconomic factors like country's gross domestic product (GDP), which affect the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

Trade  and  other  receivables  and  contract  assets  are  written  off  when  there  is  no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the Group.  Where receivables are written off, the Group continues to engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivables due.  Where recoveries are made, these are recognised in profit or loss.

## (ii) Financial assets at amortised cost

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with financial assets at amortised cost.  The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

No aging analysis of contract assets and other receivables are presented as the majority of outstanding balances as at 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023 are current.

The Company's credit risk exposure to other receivables as at 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023 are immaterial.  The Company has issued financial guarantees to banks for borrowings of its subsidiaries (see note 36). These guarantees are subject to the  impairment  requirements  of  SFRS(I)  9.  The  Company  has  assessed  that  these subsidiaries  have  sufficient  financial  capacity  to  meet  the  contractual  cash  flow obligations in the near future and hence, does not expect significant credit losses arising from these guarantees.

## (d) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.  The Group actively manages its debt maturity profile, operating cash flows and the availability of funding so as to ensure that all refinancing, repayment and funding needs are met.  As part of its overall prudent liquidity management, the Group maintains sufficient  level  of  cash  or  cash  convertible  investments  to  meet  its  working  capital requirement.  In addition, the Group strives to maintain sufficient available banking facilities to  meet working capital and funding needs.  As part of its financing strategy, the Group diversifies its borrowings by tapping into debt capital markets at the appropriate window and putting in place bank facilities.

As part of the Group's borrowing activities, the Group is exposed to the risk of potential and actual breaches of financial covenants in the Group's indebtedness which may also result in accelerated demands of payment or calls for events of default by lenders.  This may restrict the  Group's  ability  to  obtain  additional  financing  for  capital  expenditure,  acquisitions  or general corporate purposes and may cause the Group to be particularly vulnerable in any general economic downturn or instability in the global financial capital markets.

The  Group  has  been  actively  managing  its  liquidity  position  amid  the  macroeconomic challenges.  As  at  31  December  2024,  the  Group  has approximately  $11.9  billion  (2023: $10.5 billion) of total cash and available undrawn facilities held under the Group's treasury vehicles, which is sufficient to support the Group's funding requirements for the next 12 months.

The following are the expected contractual undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements:

## (e) Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities

The  Group's  derivative  transactions  that  are  not  transacted  through  an  exchange,  are governed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Netting Agreements.  In general, under such agreements, the amounts due on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount and settled between the counterparties.  In certain circumstances, for example when a credit event  such  as  a  default  occurs,  all  outstanding  transactions  under  the  agreement  are terminated, the termination value is assessed and set off into a single net amount to be settled.

The above ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the balance sheets as a right of set-off of recognised amounts is enforceable only following an event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparties.  In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

There is no offset of the Group and the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities as of the balance sheet date.

## 34 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

## (a) Determination of fair value

The valuation methods and assumptions below are used to estimate the fair values of the Group's significant classes of assets and liabilities.

## (i) Derivatives

Forward  currency  contracts,  cross  currency  swap  contracts  and  interest  rate  swap contracts are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs.  The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present valuation calculations.  The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rate, interest rate curves and forward rate curves.

## (ii) Non-derivative financial liabilities

Fair  value,  which  is  determined  for  disclosure  purposes,  is  calculated  based  on  the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted using the market rate of interest at the reporting date.

Fair value of quoted debt securities is determined based on quoted market prices.

## (iii) Other financial assets and liabilities

The fair value of quoted securities is their quoted bid price at the reporting date.  The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities with a maturity of less than one year (including trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and trade and other payables) are assumed to approximate their fair values because of the short period to maturity.  All other financial assets and liabilities are discounted to determine their fair values.

Where other valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow technique are used, estimated future cash flows are based on management's best estimates and the discount rate is a market-related rate for a similar instrument.

## (iv) Investment properties

The  Group's  investment  property  portfolio is mostly  valued by external and independent valuation companies on an annual basis.  Independent valuation is also carried out on occurrence of acquisition of investment property.  The fair values are based on open market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of the valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's length transaction wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably and without  compulsion.  The  valuers  have  considered  valuation  techniques,  mainly including  capitalisation  approach,  discounted  cash  flows  and  residual  method  in arriving at the open market value as at the reporting date.  In determining the fair value, the valuers have used valuation techniques which involve certain estimates.  The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of investment properties include marketcorroborated capitalisation rate, terminal yield rate and discount rate, estimated cost to completion and gross development value.

## (v) Assets held for sale

The fair value of the Group's investment properties held for sale is either valued by an independent valuer or based on the agreed contractual selling price on a willing buyer willing seller basis.  For investment properties held for sale valued by an independent valuer, the valuer has considered the discounted cash flow and income capitalisation approaches in arriving at the open market value as at the reporting date.  In determining the fair value, the valuer used valuation techniques which involve certain estimates. The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of investment properties held for sale include market-corroborated capitalisation rate.

## (vi) Property, plant and equipment

The fair value of the property, plant and equipment is the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of acquisition between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably and willingly.

## (vii) Share-based payment transactions

The  fair  values  of  employee  performance  share  plan  and  restricted  share  plan  are measured  using  valuation  methodology  described  in  note  22.  Measurement  inputs include the share price at grant date, expected volatility (based on an evaluation of the historical volatility of the Group's and peer group's share price), expected correlation of the Group's return with those of peer group, expected dividends yield and the riskfree interest rate (based on government bonds).  Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining the fair values.

## (b) Fair value hierarchy

The Group categorises fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that is dependent on the valuation inputs used.  The different levels have been defined as follows.

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).

- Level 3:

Inputs  for  the  asset  or  liability  that  are  not  based  on  observable  market  data (unobservable inputs).

In March 2025, a subsidiary under CLI Group, CLI Begonia Pte. Ltd., completed the acquisition of the initial 40% stake in SC Capital Partners Group (SCCP) for US$214 million (approximately S$280 million).

## 39 Adoption of New Accounting Standards

- (a) The Group has applied the following SFRS(I)s, amendments to and interpretations of SFRS(I) for the first time for the annual period beginning on 1 January 2024:
- -Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current
- -Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1: Non-current Liabilities with Covenants
- -Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-7 and SFRS(I) 7: Supplier Finance Arrangements
- -Amendments to SFRS(I) 16: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback

The Group has adopted Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 Non-current Liabilities with Covenants from 1 January  2024.  The  amendments  apply  retrospectively  and  clarify  certain  requirements  for determining whether a liability should be classified as current or non-current and require new disclosures for non-current liabilities that are subject to covenants within 12 months after the reporting period.

As disclosed in Note 19 and 20, the Group has secured bank borrowings and debt securities that are subject to specific covenants. As at 31 December 2024, the Group has complied with these covenants.

Other than the above, the adoption of the new and amended accounting standards did not have a material effect on the financial statements.

- (b) The Group has not early adopted the new standards, interpretations and amendments to standards which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025, in preparing these consolidated financial statements. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of the new standards, interpretations and amendments to standards on its financial statements.

## (i) SFRS(I) 18: Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements

SFRS(I) 18 will replace SFRS(I) 1-1 Presentation of Financial Statements and applies for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027. The new standard introduces the following key new requirements.

- -Entities  are  required  to  classify  all  income  and  expenses  into  five  categories  in  the statement  of  profit  or  loss,  namely  the  operating,  investing,  financing,  discontinued operations  and  income  tax  categories.  Entities  are  also  required  to  present  a  newlydefined operating profit subtotal. Entities' net profit will not change.
- -Management-defined performance measures (MPMs) are disclosed in a single note in the financial statements.
- -Enhanced guidance is provided on how to group information in the financial statements.

In addition, all entities are required to use the operating profit subtotal as the starting point for  the  statement  of  cash  flows  when  presenting  operating  cash  flows  under  the  indirect method.  The  Group  is  still  in  the  process  of  assessing  the  impact  of  the  new  standard, particularly  with  respect  to  the  structure  of  the  Group's  statement  of  profit  or  loss,  the statement of cash flows and the additional disclosures required for MPMs. The Group is also assessing the impact on how information is grouped in the financial statements, including the items currently labelled as 'Others'.

## (ii) Other accounting standards

The following amendments to SFRS(I)s are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's  consolidation  financial  statements  and  the  Company's  statement  of  financial position.

- -Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-21: Lack of Exchangeability
- -Amendments  to  SFRS(I)  9  and  SFRS(I)  7: Amendments  to  the  Classification  and Measurement of Financial Instruments
- -Annual Improvements to SFRS(I)s - Volume 11
