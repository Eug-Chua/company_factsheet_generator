## Summary of Risk Factors

An investment in our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants involves significant risks. Below is a summary of material risks we face, organized under relevant headings. These risks are discussed more fully after this summary. You should carefully consider the risks below and after this summary before making an investment decision. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.

## Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry

- · Our business is still in a stage of growth, and if our business or superapp platform do not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect, fail to grow as large as we expect or fail to achieve profitability, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.
- · We face intense competition across the segments and markets we serve.
- · We have incurred net losses in each year since inception and may not be able to continue to raise sufficient capital or achieve or sustain profitability.
- · Our ability to decrease net losses and achieve profitability is dependent on our ability to reduce the amount of partner and consumer incentives we pay relative to the commissions and fees we receive for our services.
- · Our businesses are subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and prospects.
- · Our brand and reputation are among our most important assets and are critical to the success of our business.
- · If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.

## Table of Contents

- · We are subject to various laws with regard to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism and have operations in certain countries known to experience high levels of corruption. Our audit and risk committee led an investigation into potential violations of certain anti-corruption laws related to our operations in one of the countries in which we operate and have voluntarily self-reported the potential violations to the U.S. Department of Justice. There can be no assurance that failure to comply with any such laws would not have a material adverse effect on us.
- · If we are required to reclassify our driver-partners as employees, if we are required to provide additional benefits, welfare and protection for our driver-partners, or if our driver-partners unionize, there may be adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences.
- · If we are unable to continue to grow our base of platform users, including driver- or merchant-partners and consumers accessing our offerings, our value proposition for each such constituent group could diminish, impacting our results of operations and prospects.

## Risks Relating to Our Corporate Structure and Doing Business in Southeast Asia

- · In certain jurisdictions, we are subject to restrictions on foreign ownership.
- · We are subject to risks associated with operating in the rapidly evolving Southeast Asia, and we are therefore exposed to various risks inherent in operating and investing in the region.
- · Our businesses may be materially and adversely affected by any changes or negative developments in the economic and political environments in any regions of Southeast Asia as well as globally.
- · Uncertainties with respect to the legal system in certain markets in Southeast Asia could adversely affect us.
- · We could face uncertain tax liabilities in various jurisdictions where we operate, and suffer adverse financial consequences as a result.

## Risks Relating to the Company's Securities

- •

The trading prices of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants have been, and may continue to be, volatile.

- · Sales of a substantial number of our securities in the public market by our existing securityholders could cause the price of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants to fall.
- · We may issue additional securities without shareholder approval in certain circumstances, which would dilute existing ownership interests and may depress the market price of our shares.
- · If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, publish inaccurate or unfavorable research or cease publishing research about us, our share price and trading volume could decline significantly.

## Risks Relating to Taxation

- · There can be no assurance that we will not be a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes for any taxable year, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders.

## Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry

Our business is still in a stage of growth, and if our business or superapp platform do not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect, fail to grow as large as we expect or fail to achieve profitability, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.

Although our business has grown rapidly, our businesses in Southeast Asia and in particular our superapp platform are still in a stage of growth, and there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve and maintain growth and profitability across all of our business segments. There is also no assurance that market acceptance of our offerings will continue to grow or that new offerings, such as digital banking, will be accepted. In addition, our business could be impacted by macroeconomic conditions and their effect on discretionary consumer spending, which in turn could impact consumer demand for our offerings.

Our management believes that our growth depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:

- · expand and diversify our deliveries, mobility, financial services and other offerings, which include innovating in new areas such as financial services (including our digital banks, which commenced commercial operations in 2022 and recently started to scale) and often requires us to make long-term investments and absorb losses while we build scale;
- · maintain and/or increase the scale of the driver- and merchant-partner base and increase consumer usage of our platform and the synergies within our ecosystem;
- · optimize our cost efficiency;
- · reduce incentives paid to driver-partners, merchant-partners and consumers;
- · enhance and develop our superapp, the tools we provide the driver- and merchant-partners and payments network along with our other technology and infrastructure;
- · recruit and retain high quality industry talent;
- · expand our business in the countries in which we operate, which requires managing varying infrastructure, regulations, systems and user expectations;
- · navigate any downward trends and volatility in macroeconomic conditions and any resulting negative impact on and fluctuations in our business;
- · expand into business activities with growth potential or which complement our existing businesses;
- · manage price sensitivity and driver- and merchant-partner and consumer preferences by segment and geographic location, particularly as we aim to increase market penetration within our markets;
- · maintain and enhance our reputation and brand;
- · ensure adequate safety and hygiene standards are established and maintained across our offerings;
- · continue to form strategic partnerships, including with leading multinationals and global brands;
- · manage our relationships with stakeholders and regulators in each of our markets, as well as the impact of existing and evolving regulations;
- · obtain and maintain licenses and regulatory approvals that may be required for our financial services or other offerings;
- · compete effectively with our competitors; and
- · manage the challenges associated with any natural disasters, health epidemics, pandemics or disease outbreaks that may significantly impact our business.

We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives.

## Table of Contents

In addition, achieving profitability will require us, for example, to continue to grow and scale our business, manage promotion and incentive spending, improve monetization, improve efficiency in marketing, reduce regional corporate costs and other spending and increase consumer spending on our platform. Our growth so far has been driven in part by incentives we offer driver-partners, merchant-partners and consumers. On-demand incentives as a percentage of on-demand GMV were relatively stable in 2023 and 2024 at 9.9% and 10%, respectively, as compared to 13.3% in 2022. The incentives as a percentage of on-demand GMV in 2023 and 2024 reflect the strategic use of incentives to drive on-demand growth in our platform.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to grow and manage each of our segments or our superapp platform or achieve or maintain profitability. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on our ability to develop appropriate strategies and plans, including our monetization, sales and marketing and cross-selling efforts, and implement such plans effectively. If driver- and merchant-partners and consumers accessing offerings through our platform do not perceive us as beneficial, or choose not to utilize us, then the market for our business may not further develop, may develop slower than we expect, or may not achieve the growth potential or profitability we expect, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## We face intense competition across the segments and markets we serve.

We face competition in each of our segments and markets. The segments and markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences, fragmentation, and introductions of new services and offerings. We compete both for driver- and merchant-partners and for consumers accessing offerings through our platform. Our competitors may operate in single or multiple segments and in a single market or regionally across multiple markets. These competitors may be well-established or new entrants and focused on providing low-cost alternatives or higher quality offerings, or any combination thereof. New competitors may include established players with existing businesses in other segments or markets that expand to compete in our segments or markets. Competitors focused on a limited number of segments or markets may be better able to develop specialized expertise or employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. Such competitors may also enjoy lower overhead costs by not operating across multiple segments and markets. Our competitors in certain geographic markets may enjoy competitive advantages such as reputational advantages, better brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes and may also offer discounted services, driver- or merchant-partner incentives, consumer incentives, discounts or promotions, innovative products and offerings, or alternative pricing models. From time to time competitive factors have caused, and may continue to cause, us to reduce prices or fees and commissions and increase driver-partner, merchantpartner or consumer incentives and marketing expenses, which has impacted and could continue to impact our revenues and costs. Furthermore, the rise of nationalism coupled with government policies favoring the creation or growth of local technology companies could favor our competitors and impact our position in our markets. In addition, some of our competitors may consolidate to expand their market position and capabilities.

## Table of Contents

In our segments and markets, the barriers to entry are low and driver- and merchant-partners and consumers may choose alternative platforms or services. Our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that consumers or driver- or merchant-partners value more highly than ours, which could render the offerings on our platform less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our offerings. The driver-partners may shift to the platform with the highest earning potential or highest volume of work, and the merchant-partners may shift to the platform that provides the lowest fees and commissions or the highest volume of business or other opportunities to increase profitability. Driver- and merchant-partners and consumers may shift to the platform that otherwise provides them with the best opportunities. Consumers may access driver or merchant goods or services through the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider or platform or a provider or platform that provides better choices or a more convenient technology platform. With respect to our platform, driver- and merchant-partners and consumers may shift to other platforms based on overall user experience and convenience, tools to enhance profitability, integration with mobile and networking applications, quality of mobile applications, and convenience of payment settlement services. In our deliveries segment, we face competition from regional players such as Foodpanda, ShopeeFood and Gojek (primarily in Indonesia) and single market players in Southeast Asia, including Deliveroo in Singapore, and Line Man Wongnai and Robinhood in Thailand. In addition, many chain merchants have their own online ordering platforms and pizza companies, such as Domino's and other merchants often own and operate their own delivery fleets. Consumers also have other options through offline channels such as in-restaurant and take-out dining, and buying directly from supermarkets, grocery and convenience stores, which may have their own delivery services. Our platform also competes with last-mile package delivery services including on-demand services such as Gojek and Lalamove, and single market players such as AhaMove in Vietnam and Transportify in the Philippines. In our mobility segment, we face competition from Gojek in Indonesia and certain other Southeast Asian countries, Xanh SM and Be Group in Vietnam, Bolt, Bonku, Robinhood, and Line Man in Thailand, Tada and Ryde in Singapore, as well as Maxim and InDrive in several Southeast Asian countries, licensed taxi operators such as ComfortDelGro in Singapore, and traditional ground transportation services, including taxi-hailing. In addition, consumers have other options including public transportation and personal vehicle ownership. Changes in local laws and regulations may also facilitate entry of local and foreign competitors into the segments we operate in, increasing competition. For example, in the Philippines, the regulator lifted the moratorium on accrediting transport network corporations (TNCs) to encourage competition. Since then, at least 14 companies, including Angkas, Joyride, and Owto, have been accredited. Additionally, recent legislation removed the 60% Filipino ownership requirement, allowing foreign-owned TNCs such as inDrive to enter the market.

While our payments and financial services offerings compete with offline options such as cash and credit and debit cards, interbank transfers, traditional banks and other financial institutions, as well as other electronic payment system operators, our competitors in digital payment services also include ShopeePay and Google Pay and single market players such as Dana and GoPay in Indonesia, and Touch 'n Go in Malaysia. Some of these competitors in digital payment services also operate e-commerce businesses. This may affect our e-wallet usage (specifically OVO and GrabPay) on these platforms due to preferential treatment that may be afforded to entities related to our competitors. Our competitors in the digital banking space are primarily new digital banks, in addition to incumbent banks in countries where our digital banks operate. In addition, while we have a non-competition agreement with Uber Technologies, Inc. ('Uber'), which was put in place in connection with a transaction with such shareholder and contractually restricts them from competing with us in Southeast Asia, such agreement is subject to limited terms. Uber previously operated in the ride-hailing and food deliveries businesses in Southeast Asia prior to our acquisition of Uber's business in Southeast Asia in 2018. The non-competition agreement with Uber will expire one year after Uber disposes of all shareholdings in us. We also had a non-competition agreement with Didi Chuxing Technology Co. ('Didi'), which was put in place in connection with a transaction with Didi. However, such non-competition agreement with Didi has formally expired upon the closing of the Business Combination in December 2021. Although the expiration of the non-competition agreement with Didi has not had any material impact on our business to date, if Didi enters, or Uber reenters, our markets, we could face more intense competition, which could in turn materially impact our ability to bring driver- and merchant-partners and consumers onto our platform, cause us to lose market share, impact our pricing and/or require us to increase our incentives in order to retain market share. Furthermore, both Uber and Didi could have certain competitive advantages compared to other new entrants into our markets given their familiarity with the markets, and in the case of Uber, due also to their shareholding in us and previous operations in Southeast Asia prior to our acquisition of Uber's business in Southeast Asia.

Any failure to successfully compete could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## Table of Contents

## We have incurred net losses in each year since inception and may not be able to continue to raise sufficient capital or achieve or sustain profitability.

We incurred net losses of $0.2 billion, $0.5 billion and $1.7 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We invest significantly in our business, including, among others, (i) expanding the deliveries, mobility and financial services offerings on our platform; (ii) increasing the scale of the driver- and merchant-partner base and consumer base accessing offerings on our platform; (iii) developing and enhancing our platforms, (iv) enhancing the tools that we provide for the driver- and merchant-partners, our payments network, digital banks and other technology and infrastructure, and (v) recruiting of quality industry talent. We are also developing our business across over 800 cities in Southeast Asia, where each country has different infrastructure, regulations, systems and user expectations, with a strategy that involves a hyperlocal approach to our operations, all of which requires more investment than if we only operated in one country and a smaller number of cities. Our offerings such as GrabRentals require us to make investments and develop scale in order to achieve profitability. To be competitive in certain markets, generate scale and increase liquidity, from time to time we lower fees and offer driver-partner, merchant-partner and consumer incentives, which also reduce our revenue. We will continue to require significant capital investment to support our business. Issuances of equity or equity-linked securities could cause existing shareholders to suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities issued may have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of existing shareholders. Debt financing could contain restrictive covenants relating to financial and operational matters including restrictions on the ability to incur additional secured or unsecured indebtedness that may make it more difficult to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all.

Our assets exceeded our liabilities by $6.4 billion as at December 31, 2024. In addition, we have deposits with banks and financial institutions, debt investments and cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 billion available. Based on these factors, together with an assessment of our business plans, budgets and forecasts, our management has been able to conclude that it is appropriate for our consolidated financial statements to be prepared on a 'going concern' basis.

Any failure to increase our revenue, manage the increase in our operating expenses, continue to raise capital, manage our liquidity or otherwise manage the effects of net liabilities and net losses, could prevent us from continuing as a going concern or achieving or maintaining profitability.

## Our ability to decrease net losses and achieve profitability is dependent on our ability to reduce the amount of partner and consumer incentives we pay relative to the commissions and fees we receive for our services.

We have paid significant amounts of incentives to attract new driver- and merchant-partners and consumers to our services, or to encourage existing registered driver-partners to return to or continue driving on our platform, in order to grow our business and generate new demand for our services and may continue to do so in the future. These incentives, which are typically in the form of additional payments made to partners and consumers, have in the past exceeded, and may in the future exceed, the amount of the commissions and fees that we receive for our services. In addition, from time to time merchantpartners may offer incentives to consumers to drive demand for their products and services on our platform, which may have the effect of reducing the portion of overall incentives paid by us. Conversely, to the extent that merchant-partners are less willing to provide such incentives, we may need to increase our incentives to keep our platform attractive. Our revenues are generally reported net of partner and consumer incentives, so if incentives exceed our commissions and fees received, it can result in us reporting negative revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we incurred incentives of $1.8 billion, $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively (comprised of partner incentives of $0.8 billion, $0.7 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, and consumer incentives of $1.1 billion, $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively) resulting in reductions to our reported revenues of the same amounts. Under the principal model which is adopted for certain delivery offerings in certain of our markets, delivery fees paid by users in that market are recognized as revenue to us, and the amount paid to driver-partners, including driver-partner incentives are recognized as a cost of revenue, and are excluded from the incentives stated above. Our monthly transacting users grew to 41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 35.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. However, we cannot assure you that our monthly transacting users will continue to grow in the future.

## Table of Contents

Our ability to increase our revenues and, in turn, decrease our net losses and achieve profitability is therefore significantly dependent on our ability to effectively use incentives to encourage the use of our platform and over time to reduce the amount of incentives we pay to both our driver- and merchant-partners and consumers of our services relative to the amount of commissions and fees we receive for our services. If we are unable to reduce the amount of incentives we pay over time relative to the commissions and fees we receive, we will likely impact our ability to increase our revenues, raise capital, reduce our net losses and achieve profitability, any or all of which could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability. In addition, given our use of incentives to encourage use of our platform, future decreases in the use of incentives could also result in decreased growth in the number of users and driverand merchant-partners or an overall decrease in users and driver- and merchant-partners and decreases in our revenues, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.

## Our businesses are subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and prospects.

We operate across the deliveries, mobility and financial services segments in over 800 cities in the large, diverse and complex Southeast Asian region. Each of our segments is subject to various regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Focus areas of regulatory risk that we are exposed to include, among others: (i) evolution of laws and regulations applicable to deliveries, mobility and/or financial services (including digital bank) offerings, (ii) various forms of data regulation such as data privacy, data localization, data portability, cybersecurity and advertising or marketing, (iii) gig economy regulations, (iv) anti-trust regulations, (v) digital platform regulations, (vi) economic regulations such as price, supply regulation, safety, health and environment regulations, (vii) foreign ownership restrictions, (viii) artificial intelligence regulation and (ix) regulations regarding the provision of online services, including with respect to the internet, mobile devices and e-commerce.

Our business is subject to regulations from various regulators within each jurisdiction in which we operate, and such regulators may not always act in concert. As a result, we may be subject to requirements which, individually, may not be materially adverse to us but when taken together could have a material impact on us. In addition, we are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the markets in which we operate. Moreover, since we operate across eight countries, regulatory scrutiny or actions in one country may lead to other regulators taking similar actions in other countries. We, with our significant and varied group of stakeholders, are highly visible to regulators across our markets. Dissatisfaction among stakeholder groups could trigger regulator intervention, impacting our business.

We may not be able to obtain all the licenses, permits and approvals that may be necessary to provide our offerings and those we plan to offer. Because the industries in which we operate are relatively new and disruptive in our market, the relevant laws and regulations, as well as their interpretations, are often unclear and evolving in certain jurisdictions. This can make it difficult for us to assess which licenses and approvals are necessary for our business, or the processes for obtaining such licenses in certain jurisdictions. For these reasons, we also cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain the licenses and approvals that we have previously obtained, or that we will be able to renew them should they expire. We cannot be sure that our interpretations of the rules and regulations, including our reliance on applicable regulatory exemptions have always been or will be consistent with those of the local regulators. As we expand our businesses, and in particular our financial services business, we may be required to obtain new licenses and will be subject to additional laws and regulations in the markets in which we plan to operate.

Segments of our businesses that are currently unregulated could become regulated, or segments of our businesses that are already regulated could be subject to new and changing regulatory requirements, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial results and prospects. Various proposals that may impact our business are currently before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities regarding issues related to our business operations and business model, or have already been adopted and implemented through new laws, rules or regulations. Compliance with existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to liabilities or cause us to incur significant expenses or otherwise impact our offerings or prospects. For example:

- · Under regulations governing the transportation business in Vietnam, we may be required to obtain a transport license in each province or city where mobility services are provided through our platform. We are currently engaging with national, provincial and city-level regulators on this requirement, which poses practical constraints for implementation, given that we believe these requirements are not appropriate or suited to a platform business such as ours. Pending the outcome of these engagement efforts, including how this requirement may be addressed under the new regulations, we may be required to make operational adjustments to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements or even shut down the affected services, in order to avoid incurring penalties (in the form of fine and/or imprisonment) or disruptions in operations, which could involve significant costs or may not be practicable.
- · In Malaysia, the government has introduced regulations on p-hailing (parcel deliveries arranged via electronic mobile application), which came into operation in 2023. Under the new regulations, we and our driver-partners who are involved in parcel deliveries will need to obtain necessary licenses once the relevant regulations come into operation and certain operational requirements may need to be met to qualify for these licenses. Depending on the implementation by the relevant authorities of the regulatory requirements, which are still being developed, if the transition period for our driver-partners to comply with and apply for the necessary license is too short, we may experience a shortage of driver-partners who carry on parcel delivery services on our platform for a period of time.
- · In Thailand, ride-hailing regulations enacted in 2021 and 2022 stipulate, among other things, how we calculate commissions and other fees and transportation fares, and impose vehicle registration and public driving licensing requirements on us and our driver-partners. It may take time for us and our driver-partners to fully comply with the new regulations, which may materially impact our supply of driver-partners and mobility business in Thailand. In addition, the Royal Decree on the Supervision of Digital Platform Service Businesses Subject to Prior Notification B.E. 2565 (2022) (the 'ETDA Law') became effective in August 2023. Subject to any issuance of its subordinate regulations, our business as a platform service provider or certain of our businesses in Thailand are likely to be considered by the ETDA to be a 'large digital service platform service provider'. In such an event, we will be required to comply with various additional obligations, including but not limited to establishing risk management, system security, and crisis management safeguards and measures. We may also need to appoint a compliance officer and undergo third-party audits. These obligations may adversely impact our business as we will need to expend significant time and resources to become compliant. The ETDA Law gives the ETDA broad discretion to enforce the terms of the ETDA Law and to protect consumers of digital platform businesses. The exact impact the ETDA Law may have on us is unclear. Further, the Strategic Transformation Office under the Prime Minister's Office in Thailand has been developing a Platform Economy Act ('PEA'), which may have elements of the EU's Digital Markets Act, targeted at governing the platform economy, which may cover our services. Since the draft PEA is still in an early stage of development, its potential impact on our business remains uncertain. In Malaysia, the Consumer Protection (Electronic Trade Transaction) Regulations, which became effective in December 2024, requires, among other things, that online marketplace operators like us to disclose merchants' information on the platform. The implementation and enforcement of these regulations remain uncertain for the industry, including us. Non-compliance with these regulations may result in material and adverse impact on our business.

There also has been pressure on governments in Southeast Asia to increase or introduce new taxes on the technology sector as it becomes a more important and profitable portion of the economy. For example, in the Philippines, a new law enacted in 2024 imposes a 12% value-added tax ('VAT') on the sale of digital services, including the services provided by us through our platform. The statutory taxpayer of the VAT would be the seller or digital service provider. This law has resulted in additional taxes being imposed on our business. In addition, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as financial services and mapping or geospatial technology, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which may require licenses to be obtained for us to provide new offerings or continue to provide existing offerings in the relevant jurisdictions.

We are subject to laws and regulations that impose general requirements and provide regulators with broad discretion in determining compliance with such laws and regulations. Regulators may interpret laws and regulations in a manner differently than us and may have broad discretion in determining any sanctions or remedial measures. Most jurisdictions in which we operate our deliveries business currently do not require a delivery license for the deliverypartners on our platform or license for delivery platform operators. In the mobility space, there are laws for ride-hailing which require ride-hailing platforms and driver-partners to apply for licenses and comply with license requirements. However, local regulators may decide to enforce or enact new local regulations, or amend existing regulations, requiring licenses, imposing caps on drivers or vehicles, mandating drivers to join a licensed entity or which impose other requirements, such as minimum age requirements for driver-partners. There are also regulations with respect to how fares are set between us and such special rental (i.e., car rental with driver) transportation companies and regulations requiring delivery driver-partners to join licensed courier companies prior to providing point-to-point delivery services through a platform such as ours. If regulations evolve or regulators change current policy or enforce local regulations, we may face additional complexity and risks in providing deliveries and mobility offerings on our platform. In addition, regulators in some jurisdictions impose a cap on both the supply, commission payable by driver-partners and fares (including other fees) applicable to our operations, and although we have in the past been able to obtain approval to increase capacity when needed, there can be no assurance that we will continue to obtain approval to increase capacity to meet demand, which could impact our business and prospects. If we or drivers become subject to further caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be adversely impacted. In certain jurisdictions, there has been public pressure to impose limits on the commissions payable by merchant-partners to platforms such as our platform, which, if imposed, could impact our deliveries business.

Our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable regulations could expose us to regulatory actions, including, but not limited to, potential fines, orders to temporarily or permanently cease all or some of our business activities, a prohibition on taking on new consumers, driver-partners or merchantpartners and the implementation of mandated remedial measures.

## Our brand and reputation are among our most important assets and are critical to the success of our business.

Our brand and reputation are among our most important assets. 'Grab' is a household name in the markets in which we operate that is synonymous with our offerings. Successfully maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our brand and reputation are critical to the success of our business, including the ability to attract and maintain employees, driver- and merchant-partners and consumers accessing offerings available on our platform, and otherwise expand our deliveries, mobility and financial services offerings. Our brand and reputation are also important to our ability to maintain our standing in the markets we serve, including with regulators and community leaders. Any harm to our brand could lead to regulatory action, litigation and government investigations and weaken our ability to effect legislative changes and obtain licenses. In addition, because we operate regionally across Southeast Asia and various segments, including deliveries, mobility and financial services, an adverse impact on our brand or reputation in one market or segment can adversely affect other parts of our business.

A variety of factors and/or incidents, including those that are actual and within our control, as well as those that are perceived, rumored, or outside of our control or responsibility, can adversely impact our brand and reputation, such as:

- · complaints or negative publicity, including those related to personal injury or sexual assault cases involving consumers using our mobility offerings or other third parties;
- · issues with the choices and quality of our products and offerings or trust in our offerings;
- · illegal or inappropriate behavior by employees, consumers or driver-partners or merchant-partners or other third parties we work with, including relating to the safety of consumers and driver- and merchant-partners;

## Table of Contents

- · improper, unauthorized, or illegal actions by third parties who conduct fraudulent or other activities, such as phishing-attacks;
- · the convenience and reliability of our superapp and technology platform, as well as any cybersecurity incidents affecting, disruptions to the availability of, or defects in, our platform or superapp;
- · issues with the pricing of our offerings or the terms on which we do business with platform users including consumers and driverand merchant-partners;
- · service delays or failures, such as missing, incorrect or canceled fulfillment of orders or rides, or issues with cleanliness, food tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling or delivery;
- · lack of community support, interest or involvement, including protests or other negative publicity that may stem from a variety of factors beyond our control, such as the general political environment, a rise in nationalism in any of the markets where we operate, unfavorable public reactions to our public communications, or acts of third parties that the public may associate with Grab;
- · failing to meet public or market expectations and act responsibly or in compliance with regulatory requirements, some of which may be evolving or ambiguous, in areas including labor, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, safety and security, data security, privacy, provision of information about consumers and activities on our platform, or environmental requirements in areas including emissions, sustainability, human rights, diversity, non-discrimination and support for employees, driver- and merchantpartners and local communities;
- · perceived anti-competitive practices or non-compliance with antitrust laws and regulations;
- · media or legislative scrutiny or litigation or investigations by regulators or other third parties; and
- · issues we may face when we roll out new initiatives, such as GrabMaps in connection with its contents, reliability and stability.

Any harm to our brand or reputation, including as a result of or related to any of the foregoing, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.

Since our inception in 2012, we have experienced growth, at times at a rapid rate, in our employee headcount, the number of consumers and driver- and merchant-partners using our platform, our offerings and the geographic reach and scale of our operations. We have also expanded both through acquisitions and strategic partnerships. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and has placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We have adopted an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process but in certain jurisdictions, our risk management function, particularly relating to enterprise-wide risk management, are in relatively early stages of maturity and therefore we may be unable to comprehensively identify, mitigate and remediate risks as they develop. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results. Properly managing our growth will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, as well as additional localized policies where necessary. A failure to effectively develop and implement any such policies could harm our business. In addition, as we expand, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff to help manage and operate our businesses, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees and staff, our business may be harmed.

## Table of Contents

To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improve the technology that supports our business operations, our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, we are required to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, upgrades to our technology or network infrastructure are critical in supporting our growth, and without effective upgrades, we could experience unanticipated system disruptions, slow response times, or poor experiences for consumers, driver- and merchantpartners. We are in the process of establishing, developing, or upgrading various management systems, such as our contract management system, purchase order management system, payment process request system and billing system, to more efficiently and effectively organize and track our activities and obligations. As our operations continue to expand, our technology infrastructure systems will need to be scaled to support our operations. In addition, our organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as our platform is used by additional consumers and driver- and merchant-partners, and as we add employees, products and offerings, and technologies. We have expanded into business activities where we have limited or no experience at all, such as grocery stores and digital banking, and may continue to do so where we see the value. If we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our platform and the efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could materially and adversely affect our brand and reputation and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We are subject to various laws with regard to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism and have operations in certain countries known to experience high levels of corruption. Our audit and risk committee led an investigation into potential violations of certain anti-corruption laws related to our operations in one of the countries in which we operate and have voluntarily self-reported the potential violations to the U.S. Department of Justice. There can be no assurance that failure to comply with any such laws would not have a material adverse effect on us.

We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business and may also be subject to such laws in other jurisdictions under certain circumstances, including, for example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the 'FCPA'). These laws generally prohibit us and our employees from improperly influencing government officials or commercial parties in order to, among other things, obtain or retain business, direct business to any person, or gain any improper advantage. Under applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, we could be held liable for acts of corruption and bribery committed by third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who acted, or may have purported to act, on our behalf. We have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities, and we are subject to the risk that we could be held liable for or be inadvertently involved in the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries and our and their respective employees, representatives, contractors, and agents, notwithstanding that we do not authorize such activities and have put in place policies, procedures and systems to prohibit and avoid the furtherance of such activities and manage such risks. Our employees frequently consult or engage in discussions with government officials in the markets where we operate with respect to potential changes in government policies or laws impacting our industries and have engaged in joint ventures and other partnerships with state-owned enterprises or government agencies, which potentially heighten such anti-corruption-related risks. In addition, our activities in certain countries with high levels of corruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by driver-partners, consumers, merchant-partners, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or business partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control and notwithstanding that we do not authorize such activities and have put in place policies, procedures and systems to prohibit and avoid the furtherance of such activities and manage such risks. While we have policies and procedures intended to address compliance with such laws, there is no guarantee that such policies and procedures are or will be fully effective at all times, and our employees and agents may take actions in violation of our policies and procedures or applicable laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. For example, our audit and risk committee led an investigation into potential violations of certain anti-corruption laws related to our operations in one of the countries in which we operate and in 2020 voluntarily self-reported the potential violations to the U.S. Department of Justice. The country did not represent a material portion of our revenue and total assets in 2022, 2023 or 2024, and while no conclusion can be drawn as to the likely outcome of the U.S. Department of Justice matter, currently we are not aware of any other contemplated or pending investigations or litigation related to the potential violations that could have a material impact on us.

## Table of Contents

Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions. Any violation of applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, harm to our reputation and brand, investigations, imposition of significant legal fees, severe criminal or civil sanctions, suspension or debarment from government licenses, permits and contracts, forced exit from an important market or business segment, substantial diversion of management's attention, a drop in our Class A Ordinary Share and Warrant prices, or other adverse consequences, any or all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## If we are required to reclassify our driver-partners as employees, if we are required to provide additional benefits, welfare and protection for our driverpartners, or if our driver-partners unionize, there may be adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences.

The independent contractor status of drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by government agencies, non-governmental organizations, groups of drivers, labor unions and trade associations all around the world. Driven in part by developments in the United States and Europe, there has been growing interest in this area recently from regulators in Southeast Asia, where we operate. The tests governing whether a driver is an independent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly sensitive to certain factors including, among others, changes in public opinion and political conditions. We believe that the driver-partners are independent contractors based on existing employment classification frameworks, because, among other things, they: (i) can choose whether, when, where, and the manner and means to provide services on our platform; (ii) are able to provide services on our competitors' platforms; (iii) have each acknowledged and agreed when signing up to our terms and conditions that their relationship with us does not constitute an employment relationship; (iv) may provide their own vehicles to perform services and, in some jurisdictions such as Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, are also able to rent cars (as lessees) from any rental company or us, if needed and to the extent permitted by laws; and (v) receive variable earnings for delivering services to our consumers or merchant-partners, rather than wages or other fixed amounts of income. Changes to laws or regulations governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification, may require reclassification of driver-partners as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), and if so, we would be required to incur significant additional expenses for compensating driver-partners, potentially including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage (which may include requirements to pay wages for periods when a driver-partner is offline or not driving through our platform), overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits (including requirements with respect to statutory contribution, compulsory insurance and trade or labor union fees), taxes, and penalties. In addition, a determination that driver-partners are employees or ostensible agents may lead to claims, charges or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees, such as claims of joint employer liability or agency liability, harassment and discrimination, and unionization. New employment classifications may be created and applied to the driver-partners, with additional requirements imposed on us beyond current requirements. Any such reclassification or new classifications could have a significant impact on our labor costs, business operations and employee relations, and an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

In Thailand, the government is working on a draft Freelancer Act aimed at protecting gig workers (including our driver-partners in Thailand). If enacted, it will introduce a new employment category, 'semi-freelancer,' and require digital platforms to contribute to a fund for these workers, cap debt offsets, and establish a dispute resolution mechanism. The Act remains uncertain as it remains under review. In the Philippines, there is no law or regulation classifying digital platform drivers as employees, but recent court rulings increase the risk of such classification, which may encourage lawsuits from driverpartners against us or induce the government to classify drivers as employees.

Although our position with respect to the independent contractor status of driver-partners has generally been upheld in relevant jurisdictions, from time to time we face challenges from driver-partners alleging employee status in certain jurisdictions. Furthermore, we have historically strived to provide driver-partner benefits and privilege schemes. Such benefits may in certain cases go beyond any statutory requirements and are used to both acquire and encourage the frequent use of our platform by driver-partners as well as to demonstrate to stakeholders and regulators that we are a responsible and good partner to our platform users. However, despite such efforts, regulators may deem our benefits and welfare schemes insufficient and impose additional requirements on companies such as us or change relevant laws or regulations. Policies could change due to, among others, driver welfare concerns with respect to matters such as income protection and certainty, long-term financial condition, professional development, the need for health or other insurance, retirement benefits, the need for fair working conditions and the desire to provide a forum to voice opinions and complaints, and we may not be successful in defending the independent contractor status of drivers in some or all jurisdictions in the future. The costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits relating to the independent contractor status of the driver-partners could be material to our business.

## Table of Contents

In addition, even if driver-partners are deemed to be our independent contractor, governments may nevertheless impose additional requirements on us with respect to our independent contractors. For example, in Singapore, the Platform Workers Act 2024 ('PWA') was enacted to create a new classification of 'platform workers' in delivery and ride-hailing services. The PWA requires us to register as a platform operator and grants certain rights to our driver-partners, even though they are not classified as employees. Key provisions include mandatory contributions to workers' statutory accounts, work injury compensation and related insurance, and a framework for worker representation. We have increased platform fees to mitigate the higher operating and compliance costs arising from the PWA. This regulation may serve as a reference for other countries as they look to adopt gig economy regulations. If similar requirements are imposed in our other markets, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. In Malaysia, a Gig Workers Bill is being developed which could increase our obligations to our driver-partners in areas such as minimum wage, grievance mechanisms and provisions of social security. There are similar efforts in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines to require digital platforms like us to offer benefits, welfare and protection to gig workers such as our driver-partners. The extent and timeline for the enactment of relevant laws and regulations remains uncertain. In Indonesia, a circular letter was issued by the Ministry of Manpower in March 2025 to urge app-based transportation service providers, including us, to provide religious festivity bonus to their online driver and courier partners.

Furthermore, driver-partners may unionize and unionization may lead to inefficiencies in implementing policy or other changes or otherwise cause us to incur increased costs, including legal and other associated costs and adversely impact consumer experience. If the driver-partners unionize and invoke collective bargaining powers, the terms of collective bargaining agreements could materially adversely affect our costs, efficiency, ability to generate acceptable returns on the affected operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, disputes with driver-partners over union and collective bargaining issues could be disruptive and harm our reputation.

If we are unable to continue to grow our base of platform users, including driver- or merchant-partners and consumers accessing our offerings, our value proposition for each such constituent group could diminish, impacting our results of operations and prospects.

Our success in a given geographic market depends on our ability to increase the scale of the driver- and merchant-partner base and the number of consumers transacting through our platform as well as expand the deliveries, mobility and financial services offerings on our platform. A key focus of our growth strategy has been to develop our superapp to create an ecosystem with synergies driving more users on both the supply and demand sides to our platform. This ecosystem, and the synergies within our ecosystem, take time to develop and grow, because doing so requires us to replicate our efforts in over 800 cities in Southeast Asia, where each country has different infrastructure, regulations, systems and user expectations and preferences, as well as a different approach to localizing our operations. Although we believe there are strong synergies among our business segments that help increase the breadth, depth and interconnectedness of our overall ecosystem, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that may impact the attractiveness of our ecosystem, including the following:

- · If consumers are not attracted to our platform or choose deliveries, mobility or financial services providers outside of our platform, we may be unable to attract driver- and merchant-partners to our platform, which in turn means consumers using our platform may have fewer choices and may not be able to obtain better value options thereby making our platform less attractive to consumers. Consumers choose our platform based on many factors, including price, the convenience of our superapp, trust in the services offered through our platform as well as our technology platform and the choices and quality of our products and offerings. A deterioration in any of these factors could result in a decline in the number of consumers using the offerings on our platform, or the frequency with which they use such offerings. In particular, despite our significant investments and devotion of resources, we may be unable to attract consumers to our recently launched digital banking business, or drive desired synergies between that business and our other businesses.

## Table of Contents

- · If driver-partners are not attracted to our platform or choose not to offer their services through our platform, or elect to offer them through a competitor's platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of driver-partners to attract and retain consumers and merchant-partners to our platform. Driver-partners choose us based on many factors, including the opportunity to earn money, the flexibility and autonomy to choose where, when and how often to work, the tools and opportunities we provide to seek to maximize productivity and other benefits that we provide to them. It is also important that we maintain a balance between demand and supply for mobility services in any given area at any given time. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience driver-partner supply constraints or oversupply from time to time in certain areas (including certain areas or locations within cities). To the extent that we experience driver-partner supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase, or may not be able to reduce, the driver-partner incentives that we offer.
- · If merchant-partners, such as restaurants, convenience and grocery stores, multinational franchises and lifestyle service providers, are not attracted to our platform or choose to partner with our competitors, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of options, or lack access to the most popular merchant-partners, such that the offerings on our platform will become less appealing to consumers and the driverpartners will have fewer opportunities to provide services. The merchant-partners choose us based on many factors, including access to the consumer base and delivery and payment network available through our platform, the tools and opportunities we provide to enhance their profitability and the opportunity to leverage our data insights. We seek to leverage off the strong consumer base using our platform in our deliveries and mobility segments to grow our financial services and other businesses.

The number of consumers using our platform may decline or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including dissatisfaction with the operation and security of our superapp or consumer support, pricing levels, dissatisfaction with the deliveries, mobility, financial services or other offerings or quality of services provided by the driver- and merchant-partners and negative publicity related to our brand or reputation, including as a result of safety incidents, driver or community protests or public perception of our business. If similar incidents occur in the future, consumer satisfaction could be impacted, which in turn could impact the balance of our ecosystem.

The number of driver- and merchant-partners on our platform may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including ceasing to provide services through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws regulating, restricting, prohibiting or taxing the services and offerings of the driver- and merchant-partners, the low costs of switching to alternative platforms, dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, our pricing model (including potential reductions in incentives), epidemics or pandemics, or other aspects of our business. Additionally, driver or community protests, which have occurred in some of our markets from time to time, could also negatively impact driver perception of us or our industry and impact our ability to recruit and maintain our base of driver- and/or merchant-partners.

In addition, the synergies we seek to realize from having a superapp-led ecosystem may not materialize as we expect them to or in a cost-effective manner. For example, we expect our superapp strategy to benefit from developing and growing our financial services offerings, which we believe will be linked to lower driver- and merchant-partner and consumer acquisition costs and increased consumer engagement, retention and spending. Further, social engagement applications may encroach on the offerings of transactional applications such as ours.

Any inability to maintain or increase the number of consumers or driver- or merchant-partners that use our platform or a failure to effectively develop our superapp could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain and enhance our ecosystem, as well as the synergies within our ecosystem, and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Security, privacy, or data breaches involving sensitive, personal or confidential information could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions, decrease trust in our platform, and increase the risk of litigation and governmental investigation.

Our business involves collecting, storing, processing, and transmitting a significant amount of personal and sensitive data, such as that of driverand merchant-partners, consumers, borrowers, employees, job candidates and other platform users and third parties. Occasionally, we may also engage thirdparty vendors to collect data, leads and other insights that we use in our business operations. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect such data. Laws and regulations that impact our business, and particularly laws, regulations and other measures governments may take based on privacy and data protection concerns, are increasingly strict and complex, change frequently and at times are in conflict among the various jurisdictions where we do business. New data privacy legislation has been discussed by governments in certain jurisdictions where we operate. In some jurisdictions, some laws and regulations require a copy of the data to be stored locally, thus requiring local servers, which would add to our cost of operations and efforts to protect the data. We may also be required to disclose personal data about an individual to a public agency, where the disclosure is necessary in the public interest, or for the purposes of policy formulation or review. Some of these disclosures may put us in a disadvantaged position, especially if the provided data is repurposed for another intent, or adequate protection is not accorded to such data. When such laws and regulations increase in number and complexity, we would be required to incur increased costs to comply with them and may incur penalties for any non-compliance or breaches. These laws may also limit how we are able to use data. For more information regarding relevant laws and regulations we are subject to, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview Regulatory Environment.'

We implement measures in order to protect sensitive and personal data in accordance with our contractual obligations, data protection laws and consumer laws. However, we remain subject to the risk that incidents involving personal data could occur as they have in the past. We also rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwise process some of our platform users' data in certain jurisdictions and we may have limited control or influence over the security policies or measures adopted by such third-party service providers. Any failure by a third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or disclosure of, such information could have adverse consequences for us.

Although we maintain and continue to improve internal access control mechanisms and other security measures to ensure secure and appropriate access to and storage and use of our sensitive, business, personal, financial or confidential information by anyone including our employees, contractors and consultants, these mechanisms may not be entirely effective, or fully complied with internally. As part of periodic reviews carried out voluntarily or otherwise by us, our consultants, or regulators or their authorized third parties, we have identified, and in the future may identify, data protection issues requiring remediation with respect to such measures that require us to further update our compliance functions. In particular, we may be at risk of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information, including any data sharing within our group. Any misappropriation of personal information, including credit card or banking information, could harm our relationship with consumers, borrowers, and driver- and merchant-partners and cause us to incur financial liability and reputational harm. If any person, including any of our employees, improperly breaches our network security or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates driver-partner, merchant-partner, consumer or borrower personal or sensitive data, we could be subject to regulatory actions and significant fines for violating privacy or data protection and consumer laws or lawsuits for breaching contractual confidentiality or data protection provisions which could result in negative publicity, legal liability, loss of consumers or driver- or merchant-partners and damage to our reputation. We are an attractive target of data security attacks by third parties that may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gain access to our data or the data of platform users. A successful attempt could lead to the compromise of sensitive, business, personal, financial, credit card, banking or other confidential information, which could result in significant liability and a material loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputation and brand, a diminished ability to retain or attract new platform users and disruption to our business.

## Table of Contents

Because the techniques used by an individual or a group to obtain unauthorized access, make unwarranted alteration to our data and source codes, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems are often complex, not easily recognizable and evasive, we may not be able to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative measures. Such individuals or groups may be able to circumvent our security measures (including, but not limited to, via phishing attacks, malware infection, system intrusion, misuse of systems, website defacement, and DDoS attacks) and may improperly access or misappropriate confidential, proprietary, or personal information held by or on behalf of our company, disrupt our operations, damage our computers, or otherwise damage our business. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our servers, platform and data, including personal and sensitive data of the driver-partners, merchant-partners, consumers, borrowers, employees, job candidates and other platform users and third parties, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be effective at all times. Our efforts may be hindered due to, for example, government surveillance, regulatory requirements or other external events; software bugs or other technical errors or issues; or errors or misconduct of employees, contractors or others; a rapidly evolving threat landscape; and inadequate or failed internal processes or business practice. While we invest significant resources to protect against or remediate cybersecurity threats or breaches, or to mitigate the impact of any breaches or threats, we may still be subject to potential liability above the amounts covered by our insurance. In addition, because of our prominence in Southeast Asia and the large number of users on our platform, any perceived failure of our internal controls and security measures may negatively impact our reputation.

As required by data privacy laws, we generally obtain consents from data subjects for the purposes for which personal data are collected. However, regulators and/or data subjects may perceive a lack of transparency in our communication with data subjects concerning the transfers of data between us and other entities (including our digital banks), potentially exposing us and such other entities to privacy compliance risks.

Any of the foregoing could subject us to regulatory fines, scrutiny and actions, including, but not limited to, orders to temporarily or permanently cease all or some of our business activities, a prohibition on taking on new consumers, driver-partners or merchant-partners and the implementation of mandated remedial measures, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## Our financial services business, including digital banking, may not ultimately be successful and could subject us to additional risks, requirements, and regulations.

We have expanded, and plan to continue to expand, our financial services offerings and platform. These offerings include services such as digital banking (primarily unsecured loans, deposits and payment methods) and GFG's other financial services (primarily payments, lending, receivables factoring, insurance distribution and captive insurance business). During 2024, we launched our insurance underwriting business that allows us to develop and distribute insurance products in Singapore. Expanding our financial services offerings requires us to engage in activities such as education of driver- and merchantpartners, building awareness of our financial services and banking offerings, attracting and retaining talent with relevant financial services and banking skills, entering into arrangements with new partners, and also exposes us to risks including, among others, strategic risks, credit risks, fraud risks, capital, market and liquidity risks, operational risks, third-party risks, technology, information and cybersecurity risks, model risks, reputational risks, regulatory and compliance risks, financial crime risks and market conduct risks.

While our digital banks have received approval from their respective regulators to commence restricted business activities in Singapore and Malaysia, and have accordingly launched certain commercial operations, they have yet to receive the approval to conduct full business activities without restrictions. As our lending business, including that of our digital banks, grows, we face increased exposure to credit cycle volatility and potential credit losses due to deterioration in borrowers' credit profile, which may result from, among other things, changes in the economic, political, social and regulatory environment. In addition, as our digital banks and insurance business are in their early stages of operation, they are ramping up the establishment of robust internal processes necessary for daily operations, such as customer acquisition and service, product launches, internal reporting, risk management, and regulatory compliance. Given their novelty, these processes may not function as intended or at all. Any failure or malfunction of these processes could have a significant impact on the banks' operations and their ability to serve their customers effectively, and could result in fines, sanctions, or other regulatory actions due to breaches of applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, if any artificial intelligence, statistical or machine learning models within our digital banking or insurance business underperform or malfunction, we may sustain financial, reputational or regulatory impacts.

## Table of Contents

Our business is subject to laws that govern payment, financial services, insurance and banking activities and we may face challenges in obtaining and maintaining licenses and regulatory approvals and in maintaining relationships with regulators. As we evolve our business, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to deposits, money transmission, lending, consumer protection, online payments, insurance distribution, captive insurance business and other financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism, lending, consumer protection, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, cybersecurity of payment processes, and import and export restrictions. Regulators in certain jurisdictions, including Singapore and Malaysia, have been reviewing buy now, pay later offerings with a view to limiting consumer overspending and adoption of fair dealing practices, among other things. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose requirements or curbs on such offerings and any such requirements or curbs could adversely impact us. We are subject to regulatory examinations in all markets where we operate financial services businesses for which we are licensed, and such examinations carry the risk that regulators could allege violations or view our continued participation in the market, as an overseas company, undesirable, and impose sanctions, penalties or withdraw our licenses.

We also maintain licensing relationships with all major credit card providers and have established key relationships with banks. Any contractual disputes over fees or other violations, or in relation to the implementation of our joint ventures, may result in restrictions or withdrawal of one or more scheme's or banking partner's services. Furthermore, our financial services business and the use of such services have historically relied significantly on our deliveries and mobility segments, as consumers often use GrabPay to pay for deliveries and mobility services offered through our platform. The expansion of our financial services business will depend to a large extent upon our ability to continue to grow the use of our financial services for uses outside of our deliveries and mobility segments.

As a new entrant in the financial services industry, we face intense competition with existing banks and financial services providers that may have greater experience, better access to capital, a lower cost of capital and more resources than we have. Our ability to achieve or maintain market acceptance for our financial services and products are affected by a number of factors, such as the community's level of trust in digital financial services and products being provided by a company that is not a traditional financial institution, entrenched preferences in traditional payment methods, insufficient use cases for our digital payment or banking services and lack of infrastructure support locally. Moreover, even if there is adequate acceptance of our digital financial services and products, our business will continue to be subject to the changing needs and demands of users, which may change for various reasons such as availability of alternative payment, banking or lending methods that are more popular or widely accepted by the population.

Any of the foregoing, including any failure to manage these risks, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## Improper, dangerous, illegal, fraudulent or otherwise inappropriate activity by consumers or driver- or merchant-partners or other third parties could harm our business and reputation and expose us to liability.

Due to the breadth of our operations that span a wide variety of consumers, driver- and merchant-partners and other third parties in over 800 cities in Southeast Asia, we are exposed to potential risks and liabilities arising from improper, dangerous, illegal, fraudulent or otherwise inappropriate actions by a wide variety of persons that we have no control over. Although we have implemented certain measures in order to ensure both partner and consumer safety and protection of our business from such actions, such measures may not be effective or adequate and any such actions may result in adverse consequences, such as nuisance, property damage, injuries, fatalities, business interruption, brand and reputational damage, loss of revenue or profits or incurrence of liabilities for us.

Although there are generally certain qualification processes in place for the driver- and merchant-partners, including background checks on driver-partners, these qualification processes may not bring to light all potentially relevant information and would not bring to light events occurring after the qualification process is complete. In certain jurisdictions, available information may be limited by applicable laws or limited generally, and we (or third-party service providers we use to conduct background checks) also may fail to conduct qualification processes adequately. Furthermore, we do not independently test the driving skills of the driver-partners or other relevant skills of our other merchant-partners. In addition, the absence of past negative records does not guarantee appropriate behaviors in the future.

## Table of Contents

In our mobility business, if the driver-partners or consumers engage in improper, dangerous, illegal, fraudulent or otherwise inappropriate activities, driver-partners and/or consumers may not consider offerings on our platform to be safe and we may otherwise suffer adverse consequences, such as liability due to bodily harm to other users of our platform, direct or indirect loss of revenue or profit, and other brand and reputational damage. For example, in Cambodia, most of our two-wheel and three-wheel driver-partners do not obtain (and in certain cases are not required to obtain) driver's licenses, which could subject them and us to potential risks. In addition, merchant-partners in some of the countries in which we operate are not required to obtain food hygiene certificates or may only be subject to limited regulatory guidelines with regard to food safety and hygiene.

In our financial services business, we may also be susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, which may include the use of our payment services in connection with fraudulent sales and/or refund of goods or services, software and other intellectual property piracy, money laundering, bank fraud and prohibited sales of restricted products. If consumers or third parties providing financial services in partnership with us engage in improper, illegal, fraudulent or otherwise inappropriate activities while using our platform, other consumers and driver- and merchant-partners may also be unwilling to continue using our platform. Despite measures that we have taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot guarantee that our measures will be effective. With respect to our loan products, as our lending decisions are based partly on information provided to us by applicants, if the information or identity provided to us by loan applicants is incorrect or fraudulent, our credit decisions may not accurately reflect the associated risks. Additionally, new tools and methods for perpetrating fraud on bank customers, especially scams, are a growing problem in Southeast Asia. Scam operations often involve large-scale set-ups akin to call centers, whose purpose is to convince victims to transfer funds or surrender their bank account credentials to the fraudsters. More hi-tech fraudsters may employ phishing techniques and artificial intelligence, such as deepfakes of the victim's social connections. These novel defrauding tools and methods may result in large financial losses to our digital bank customers, which in turn may cause significant financial losses to our digital banks as the victim customers may have difficulty repaying their loans. Additionally, as we provide near real-time online financial services, including online banking, there is additional complexity of preventing, detecting and recovering fraudulent transactions.

Any of the foregoing activities, whether or not caused by or known to us, could harm our brand and reputation, result in litigation or regulatory actions, and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## We are subject to risks associated with strategic alliances and partnerships.

We have entered into strategic alliances and partnerships with third parties and may continue to do so in the future. Such alliances and partnerships have included, among others, joint ventures or minority equity investments, such as our investments in the Digital Banking JV with Singtel and partnerships with strategic investors, including with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. ('MUFG') for certain digital financial services, such as payments and lending, and with Toyota in several areas related to supporting driver-based services. These alliances and partnerships subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with the sharing of proprietary information between parties, non-performance by us or our partners of obligations under relevant agreements, disputes with strategic partners over strategic or operational decisions or other matters, increased expenses in establishing new strategic alliances and non-compete provisions under some of such arrangements which limit our ability to operate in certain market segments, the need to support or capitalize joint venture or associate entities and reputational risks from association with strategic partners, as well as litigation risks associated therewith. In addition, Singtel has the right to swap all (but not a portion) of its shares in the Digital Banking JV for shares of GFG if GFG pursues a public offering prior to an IPO of the Digital Banking JV, subject to the terms of the shareholders agreement for the Digital Banking JV and relevant consents being obtained from the MAS in connection with the digital full bank license. Accordingly, we will experience dilution of our ownership of GFG if Singtel exercises its right to swap its shares in the Digital Banking JV for GFG shares. In addition, we have entered into a binding agreement with Singtel with respect to the Digital Banking JV that may result in Singtel's swap of its shares in the Digital Banking JV for Class A Ordinary Shares. See '-Risks Relating to Our Corporate Structure and Doing Business in Southeast Asia-We may issue additional securities without shareholder approval in certain circumstances, which would dilute existing ownership interests and may depress the market price of our shares.'

## Table of Contents

Furthermore, some of our strategic alliances and partnership agreements contain exclusivity provisions restricting us from providing a particular service outside of the strategic alliance or partnership in a particular jurisdiction. For example, we and MUFG have entered into an agreement for strategic collaboration under which we have granted MUFG's affiliates in Thailand exclusivity with respect to the provision of certain financial products and services to the driver- and merchant-partners and consumers and we have also granted MUFG's affiliates a right of first offer with respect to certain financial products and services in our markets in which we intend to offer collaboration or partnership with third-party financial institutions. Subject to certain exceptions and carveouts, the shareholders agreement with Singtel for the Digital Banking JV contains restrictions on investments in other digital banking and other financial services businesses as well as restrictions on operating certain banking and financial services businesses outside of the Digital Banking JV. In addition, restrictions may be imposed by applicable regulations and/or in connection with the grant of the digital full bank license. The Digital Banking JV partners have agreed on a process for expanding digital banking and certain financial services into Southeast Asian jurisdictions beyond Singapore. Although we agreed to such restrictions because we believe that the overall strategic alliance or partnership is to our benefit, such restrictions could adversely impact our growth prospects.

## Our operation of digital banking in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia through joint ventures is subject to risks.

GXS Bank, the digital bank that our Digital Banking JV operates in Singapore, has commenced restricted business activities for the public since September 2022 and has continued to expand its operations during 2024. The Digital Banking JV must comply with relevant banking regulations and other requirements on an ongoing basis. As our ownership and management control may evolve, we need to ensure continued adherence to the MAS requirement that the Digital Banking JV be 'anchored in Singapore, controlled by Singaporeans and headquartered in Singapore'. Details of our corporate governance structures have been shared and aligned with the MAS's expectations. However, the MAS, at its sole discretion, may determine that future events cause the Digital Banking JV to no longer meet such requirement, which could have adverse consequences. These consequences may include but are not limited to the Digital Banking JV having our digital full bank license suspended or revoked, or failing to obtain the MAS's approval to conduct full business activities without restrictions. The MAS may take other actions to ensure that the Digital Banking JV is anchored in Singapore, controlled by Singaporeans and headquartered in Singapore. This could require us to sell or transfer existing shares in the Digital Banking JV to, or enter into proxy arrangements with, or could require the Digital Banking JV to issue new shares to, the joint venture partner, Singtel, or other Singapore citizens or entities. Furthermore, according to the MAS's eligibility criteria, among other requirements, holders of the digital full bank licenses will need SGD 1.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) in minimum paidup capital as well as additional capital to accommodate certain losses as determined by the MAS. As such, the terms of the shareholders agreement with Singtel for the Digital Banking JV includes the obligation for us and our joint venture partner to make capital contributions to the Digital Banking JV of up to SGD 1.93 billion (approximately $1.4 billion) in total, which includes provision for retained losses. We believe both we and our joint venture partner, Singtel, each have sufficient cash resources to satisfy their respective obligations when due, and both parties have demonstrated to the MAS that they have sufficient corporate funds to meet their respective funding obligations. We also have the obligation to indemnify our joint venture partner Singtel from and against certain losses resulting from breaches by us of undertakings to make committed capital contributions, undertakings given to the MAS or revocation of the digital full bank license or material restrictions being imposed on our Digital Banking JV on account of an action taken by us and to indemnify bank customers against any shortfall in non-bank deposits. In addition, upon certain events of default occurring, including a change of control of GFG before 2025, our joint venture partner Singtel may, subject to regulatory approval, sell its Digital Banking JV shares to us at a 20% premium over fair market value, or purchase our Digital Banking JV shares at a 20% discount to fair market value.

Further, our expansion into digital banking in Malaysia and Indonesia through joint ventures brings us increased risks. GXBank, our digital bank in Malaysia that has commenced the foundational phase of banking operations since November 2023, involves a six-way joint venture, and PT Super Bank Indonesia (in which we have 30.84% equity interest) is a five-way joint venture. This introduces the risk of non-alignment between the interests of the individual joint venture partners, the possibility of joint venture partners failing to fund their capital contributions, partner insolvency, local political risks from operating as a foreign owned entity, and regulatory risks if the joint venture partners no longer meet regulators' expectations as qualifying appropriate shareholders of a bank.

## Table of Contents

## The expansion of our digital banking business regionally may cause our other group companies to be designated as financial holding companies and subject them to additional compliance, reporting and capital obligations.

Regional expansion of our digital bank business brings its own risks and the potential for regulatory or contractual difficulties in one country to negatively impact the operations of the banks in the other countries. As with Singapore, both the Malaysian and Indonesian regulatory authorities require a series of indemnities, and depositor protection structures to be implemented which obligations could ultimately impact the wider Grab group. While we participate where required in statutory depositor insurance and protection schemes, the expectation is that the nature of support and assurances given by such schemes would be secondary to reliance on Grab group's funds.

As our digital banking business evolves, it is increasingly possible that one or more of our banking regulators would designate our other group companies as financial holding companies. The likelihood of this is also impacted by the launch in Singapore of our insurance underwriting business following the receipt of an insurance license. Such requirements would in certain jurisdictions typically result in (i) increased information reporting requirements; (ii) increased capital provision on the regulated entity or its affiliates; (iii) increased restrictions on liabilities; and (iv) requirement to abide by regulatory directions on affiliates and the foreign holding companies in addition to the actual digital banking operations. While we plan to work closely with regulators to mitigate and manage any potential negative impact of such designation, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in reducing or managing any such negative impact.

## We rely significantly on third-party cloud infrastructure services providers and software-as-a-service ('SaaS') providers and any disruption of or interference with the use of our services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Our platform is currently hosted within data centers provided by third-party cloud infrastructure services providers and we use a number of SaaS platforms in our business operations. As the continuing and uninterrupted performance of our platform and business operations is critical to our success, any system failures of such third-party providers' services could interrupt our business operations, reduce the attractiveness of our platform and may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of consumers and driver- and merchant-partners when they are using our platform. Third-party cloud infrastructure services providers and SaaS providers are vulnerable to damage or interruptions from factors beyond our or their control, including but not limited to computer viruses and other malicious code, denial-of-service attacks, cyber and ransomware attacks, phishing attacks, break-ins, sabotage, vandalism, data leaks, power loss or other telecommunications failure, fire, flood, hurricane, tornado or other natural disasters, software or hardware errors, failures or crashes and other similar disruptive problems. We occasionally suffer from loss of orders or transactions due to technical failures, system delays or other interruptions on the part of our third-party cloud infrastructure providers. We expect that in certain jurisdictions, it may become increasingly difficult to ensure reliability of our platform as we expand and the usage of our platform increases. Any future disruptions could adversely impact our business operations, user experience, create negative publicity harming our reputation, impact the quality, availability and speed of the services we provide as well as potentially violate regulatory requirements and fall short of regulatory expectations in relation to technology risk and business continuity risk management. Any of the foregoing could result in interruptions, delays, loss of data, cessations to our operations or in the provision of offerings through our platform and compensation payments to our partners and end consumers, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Furthermore, under our agreements with our third-party cloud infrastructure services providers, we are required to meet certain minimum spending commitments. To the extent we fall short of meeting such commitments, we could be required by the relevant service provider to pay for the shortfall, which would cause us to incur additional expenses.

We may continue to be blocked from, or limited in, providing our products and offerings in certain markets, may contravene applicable laws and regulations and may be required to modify our business model in order to manage our compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Many markets in Southeast Asia may have laws and regulations that do not sufficiently contemplate or cover all of our business activities. As our business, business model, products, offerings and operations may be relatively new in these markets, the relevant laws and regulations, as well as their interpretations, may be unclear and evolving. This may make it difficult for us to assess which licenses, permits and approvals are necessary for our business, or the processes for obtaining such licenses, permits and approvals. This mismatch between our businesses and laws in the jurisdictions where we operate may also subject us to inconsistent, uncertain and arbitrary application of such laws and increased regulatory scrutiny. We may also proceed with business activities on a risk-weighted assumption that certain laws and regulations are invalid or inapplicable, which may not be the case. As part of our decision-making process in such circumstances, we have a cross functional team, which includes representatives from our enterprise risk management, legal and compliance, public affairs and public relations teams, that engages in considering such issues and making decisions that are consistent with our corporate culture (which includes sustainable growth and a strong focus on compliance) and common sense. We also, as part of our decision-making process, typically seek advice from local law firms with expertise on local regulatory considerations. In certain markets, we financed and provided offerings, either directly or through others with whom we had affiliations, while we are still assessing or considering the applicability of laws and regulations to those offerings or while we considered potential changes we may need to implement to comply with such laws and regulations. Our decision to continue operating in these instances has been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. There may have been instances where we were not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or did not have all required licenses, permits and approvals needed to conduct the relevant business.

Many of the markets in Southeast Asia have not developed a fully integrated regulatory regime, and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in such markets, including, in particular, new or disruptive business models such as those in the technology sector. In Thailand, a new law that became effective on July 1, 2024 categorizes GrabFood, GrabMart and GrabExpress as regulated online delivery services, and is expected to be supplemented by pricing control regulations. The pricing control regulation, if enacted, may restrict our ability to introduce new fees and/or adjust fees to properly reflect supply and demand. Furthermore, Thai regulators are considering enacting laws to regulate commissions chargeable to merchant-partners, which may have a negative impact on our business. A new draft law in relation to ride-hailing business is being considered by ETDA in Thailand, which may also impact supply and continuity of our mobility business and certain business operations in the country. In Indonesia, a new Drug and Food Authority regulation that became effective in July 2024 governs the online distribution of medicine. We are in the process of adjusting the business process and obtaining the relevant licenses and registration as required by the regulation. Regulatory risks, including but not limited to the foregoing, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In certain circumstances, we may not be aware of our violation of certain policies, laws and regulations until after the violation. Where regulators find that we have not obtained required licenses, permits and approvals, we may come under investigation or otherwise be subject to scrutiny by governmental authorities, may be subject to regulatory fines and penalties and, in certain cases, may be required to cease operations altogether, unless and until laws and regulations are reformed. The regulatory environment in Southeast Asia may also slow the growth of our business. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in managing our legal and regulatory matters, including the ability to operate our business in our markets.

## The proper uninterrupted functioning of our highly complex technology platform is essential to our business.

Our business depends on the performance and reliability of our system as well as the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems that are not under our control. In June 2022, we launched GrabMaps, a mapping and location-based service, which also fully powers our Grab services, and our business is dependent on the uninterrupted operation of GrabMaps. Our superapp platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex, and therefore, many events that are beyond our control may cause service interruptions or degradations or other performance problems across the whole platform, including but not limited to computer viruses and other malicious code, denial-of-service attacks, cyber and ransomware attacks, phishing attacks, break-ins, sabotage, vandalism, power loss or other telecommunications failure, fire, flood, hurricane, tornado or other natural disasters, software or hardware errors, failures or crashes, and other similar disruptive problems. From time to time we experience small-scale disruptions where each disruption impacts the availability of our platform for a relatively short period of time concerning some but not all of our businesses or countries in which we operate. . We may experience system failures and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. Although we have certain disaster response procedures, we or our third-party service providers may not currently have a comprehensive business continuity framework in place in all instances. We are working with third-party consultants to develop a suitable business continuity framework, but there can be no assurance that such framework will be implemented in a cost-effective manner or at all, or that it will prove effective or meet all the expectations of our stakeholders, including our consumers, partners and regulators, both current and in the future, in relation to cybersecurity risk, technology risk and business continuity management, which may also impact our current and prospective licensing in certain jurisdictions.

Our software, including third-party or open source software that is incorporated into our software code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems and unintended interactions between systems could result in our failure to comply with certain regulatory reporting obligations or compliance requirements or the introduction of vulnerabilities into our platform that may be exploited by cyber-attackers or third-parties engaging in fraudulent activities, or could cause downtime that would impact the availability of our platform, which could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to users, increase the likelihood of a successful cyber-attack or result in violations of regulators' expectations of prescribed technology risk management practices. Cyber-attackers and third-parties engaged in fraudulent activities have in the past exploited vulnerabilities in our platform and may in the future continue to attempt to do so. If the measures we take to prevent these incidents from occurring are unsuccessful, we may incur losses from these fraudulent activities.

Disruptions in internet infrastructure, the absence of available mobile data or global positioning system signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the necessary bandwidth for our products and offerings could also interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. Our operations may also rely on virtual private network access in certain jurisdictions, such as China, where we have research and development operations.

Furthermore, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications operators. If mobile internet access fees or other charges to internet users increase, consumer traffic may decrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to significantly decrease. Our operations also rely on various other third-party software and applications, including with respect to intragroup communications and online word processing, and disruptions with respect to our usage of any such software could cause business interruption. Furthermore, although we seek to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and to enable rapid releases of new features and services, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more complex and more products and services are offered through our superapp and user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when driver- and merchant-partners, consumers and/or platform users attempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints, users may seek other offerings including our competitors' products or offerings, and may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all. This could adversely affect our ability to maintain our ecosystem of driver- and merchant-partners and consumers and decrease the frequency with which they use our platform. We may not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade systems as needed, or develop technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology.

Any of these events could significantly disrupt our operations, impact user satisfaction and in turn our reputation and subject us to liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## Table of Contents

## Our business depends upon the interoperability of our superapp and platform with different devices, operating systems and third-party software that we do not control.

One of the most important features of our superapp and platform is the broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Our superapp and platform are accessible from the web and from devices running various operating systems such as iOS and Android. We depend on the accessibility of our superapp and platform across these third-party operating systems and applications that we do not control. Moreover, third-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure our compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. The loss of interoperability, whether due to actions of third parties or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

As new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will continue to support our platform or effectively roll out updates to our applications. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed to work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users' experience. If consumers or driver- and merchant-partners that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our applications on their mobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, platform growth and user engagement would be adversely affected.

We also depend on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store, Google Play and Huawei App Gallery, which make our superapp and other apps available for download. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces, through which we distribute our superapp and other apps, will maintain their current structures or that such marketplaces will not charge us fees to list our applications for download. If any such marketplaces cease making our superapp or other apps available, this would have a material adverse effect on our business.

In addition, we rely upon certain third parties to provide software or application programming interfaces ('APIs') for our products and offerings, which are currently important to the functionality of our platform. If such third parties cease to provide access to such third-party software or APIs on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may be required to seek comparable solutions from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior and/or adversely impact user experience. In some cases, such third-party commercial software may be difficult to replace, or become unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms. Any such changes to or unavailability of third-party software or APIs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if third parties claim that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant costs and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.

Our brand value and technology, including our intellectual property, are some of our core assets. We protect our proprietary rights through a combination of intellectual property and contractual rights. These include patents, registered designs, trademarks, copyright, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with third parties, employee and contractor disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other similar contractual rights. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. For instance, intellectual property laws, rules and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we currently operate. In addition, it may be possible for other parties to copy or reverse-engineer our products and offerings or obtain and use the content of our website without authorization. Further, we may be unable to prevent competitors from acquiring domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our domain names, trademarks, service marks and other proprietary rights. In the event of any unauthorized use of our intellectual property or other proprietary rights by third parties, legal and contractual remedies available to us may not adequately compensate us. We primarily rely on copyrights and confidential information (including source code, trade secrets, know-how and data) protections, for the purposes of protecting our core technologies and proprietary databases, rather than registered rights such as patents. Further, the registration of intellectual property, especially across multiple jurisdictions, is costly, subject to complex laws, rules and regulations, and can be challenged by third parties, and we may choose to limit or not to pursue intellectual property registrations in the future. Our reliance on copyrights and confidential information protections, rather than registered intellectual property rights, may make it more difficult for us to protect some of our core technologies against third-party infringement and could increase the risk of third-party infringement actions against us.

## Table of Contents

We may also be unable to detect infringement of our intellectual property rights, and even if such violations are found, we may not be successful, and may incur significant expenses in protecting our rights. In addition, our competitors may independently develop technology or services that are equivalent or superior to our technology services. Any enforcement efforts may be time-consuming, costly and may divert management's attention. Any failure to protect or any loss or dissolution of our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Furthermore, as we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we may in the future receive notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed upon other parties' intellectual property rights. In addition, as our strategic alliances and partnerships at times involve sharing of intellectual property, we are subject to the risk of our partners alleging we have misappropriated or misused such partner's intellectual property or our partners infringing our intellectual property.

Any intellectual property claims against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, could divert our management's attention and other resources, and could hurt goodwill associated with our brand. These claims may also subject us to significant liability for damages and may result in us having to stop using technology, content, branding, or business methods found to be in violation of another party's rights. Certain adverse outcomes of such proceedings could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses.

We may also be required or may opt to seek a license for the right to use intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we may be required to pay significant royalties, which may increase our operating expenses. If alternative technology, content, branding, or business methods for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business are not available, we may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions. Any of these results could harm our business.

## We may not be able to make acquisitions or investments, or successfully integrate them into our business.

As part of our business strategy, we have entered into and regularly pursue a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including strategic investments, alliances, partnerships, joint ventures and acquisitions, in each case relating to businesses, technologies, services and other assets that we expect to complement our business or that we believe will help to grow our business. For example, in January 2022, we completed the acquisition of a majority economic interest in Jaya Grocer. In August 2022, we acquired the business operations of Move It, a motorcycle-hailing application based in the Philippines. In July 2024, we acquired Chope, a restaurant reservation platform in certain parts of Southeast Asia, and in December 2024 we acquired the operations of Nham24, a food delivery platform in Cambodia. In March 2025, we acquired a majority interest in Everrise, a premium supermarket chain that operates predominately in East Malaysia. We have also made other acquisitions and investments which we believe will complement our business.

These types of transactions involve numerous risks, including, among others:

- · intense competition for suitable targets and partners, which could increase prices and adversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;
- · complex technologies, terms and arrangements, which may be difficult to implement and manage;
- · failures or delays in closing transactions;
- · difficulties integrating brand identity, technologies, operations, existing contracts, and personnel;
- · difficulties implementing our corporate or compliance policies and guidelines with the acquired entities effectively;
- · failure to realize the anticipated return on investment, benefits or synergies;
- · exclusivity provisions which prevent us from providing a particular service outside of the strategic alliance or partnership in a particular jurisdiction which could serve to limit access to business opportunities;

- · failure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company, partner or technology, including but not limited to issues related to intellectual property, cybersecurity risks, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, security interests over assets, contractual issues, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;
- · expanding into business activities where we have limited experience, such as offline businesses, or no experience at all;
- · failure to retain key employees, to ensure that we can preserve value in the existing platform and avoid loss of institutional knowledge;
- · risks that regulatory bodies do not approve our acquisitions or business combinations or delay such approvals or other adverse reactions from regulators, which may result in blockade, delay or restructuring of such transactions;
- · regulatory changes that require adjustments to our business or shareholding or rights in relation to subsidiaries or joint ventures;
- · any significant use of cash or incurrence of debt to finance the transactions may restrict our business and any issuance of equity and/or convertible note to finance or otherwise complete the transactions may result in dilution to our shareholders;
- · adverse reactions to acquisitions by investors and other stakeholders; and
- · distraction of our management from executing our existing roadmap as each strategic transaction will require management bandwidth to negotiate, execute and integrate.

If we fail to address the risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future transactions such as the foregoing, or if we fail to successfully integrate or manage such transactions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.

## Any failure by us or our third-party service providers to comply with applicable anti-money laundering or other related laws and regulations could damage our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operation, or subject us to other risks.

Our payment and financial services related businesses, operations and systems may, in certain jurisdictions, be governed by laws and regulations related to payment and financial services activities, including, among other things, laws and regulations relating to banking, privacy, cross-border and domestic money transmission, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, electronic funds transfers, systemic integrity risk assessments, cybersecurity of payment processes, import and export restrictions and consumer protection. Our payment and financial services related activities may be susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services, and payments to sanctioned parties. These laws and regulations to which we are now, or in the future may be, subject to may be highly complex, vague, and could change and may be interpreted to make it challenging or impossible for us to comply with them. Moreover, activities in jurisdictions where we allow payments in cash may raise additional legal, regulatory, and operational concerns. Operating a business that uses cash may increase our compliance risks with respect to a variety of laws and regulations, including those referred to above. In addition, we may in the future offer new payment options that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, fines, and higher transaction fees, and we may not be able to continue to accept or process online payment, payment card or other related transactions, which could make offerings on our platform less convenient and attractive. In the event of any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.

As our payments and financial services related businesses expand, we will need to continue to invest in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and to conduct appropriate risk assessments and implement appropriate controls. Government authorities may scrutinize or seek to bring actions against us if our systems are used for improper or illegal purposes or if our risk management or controls are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and the foregoing could result in financial or reputational harm to our business.

## Table of Contents

In addition, laws and regulations related to payments and financial services are evolving, and changes in such laws and regulations could affect our ability to provide services on our platform in the manner that we have done, expect to do, or at all. In addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our operations, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations. Historical or future non-compliance with these laws and regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits on our ability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.

## We rely on our partnerships with financial institutions and other third parties for payment processing infrastructure and for the provision of services through our platform.

The convenient payment mechanisms provided by our superapp and platform are key factors contributing to the development of our business. We rely on strategic partnerships with financial institutions such as Visa and Mastercard and third parties such as Adyen and Stripe for elements of our paymentprocessing infrastructure to process and remit payments to and from consumers and driver- and merchant-partners using our platform. Although we may develop in-house payment processing capabilities, we will likely need to continue to rely on these strategic partnerships and third-party services. If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on acceptable terms or at all, our business may be disrupted. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay interchange fees and other processing and gateway fees, and such fees result in significant costs.

In addition, online payment providers are under continued pressure to pay increased fees to banks to process funds, and there is no assurance that such online payment providers will not pass any increased costs. If these fees increase over time, our operating costs will increase, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Failures of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform could cause driver- and merchant-partners to lose trust in our payment operations and could cause them to instead use our competitors' platforms. If the quality or convenience of our payment processing infrastructure declines as a result of these limitations or for any other reason, the attractiveness of our business to driver- and merchant-partners could be adversely affected. If we are forced to migrate to other third-party payment service providers for any reason, the transition would require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by platform users.

Additionally, online payment providers require us to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain services to some users, be costly to implement, or be difficult to follow. If we fail to comply with these rules or regulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and/or lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments. We have also agreed to reimburse our third-party payment processor for any reversals, chargebacks, and fines that are assessed by payment card networks if we violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, as a platform business, our business model generally provides a platform enabling driver- and merchant-partners and other third parties, such as insurance companies and financial institutions, to reach a broad base of consumers through our platform. To the extent such third parties use other means to reach consumers instead of our platform, our business could be adversely impacted as we do not provide the services offered through our platform ourselves.

## Changes in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect us.

Competition authorities closely scrutinize us. There has been increased scrutiny over the power and influence of big technology companies globally, and in particular, antitrust regulators in Southeast Asia have taken greater interest in potential abuses of market power or position, agreements and transactions by big technology companies. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions on our business or transactions, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, could result in adverse publicity or fines, or prevent the implementation of transactions, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.

## Table of Contents

For example, there has been increased scrutiny from the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore ('CCCS') in the online food delivery and virtual kitchen sectors, and if the CCCS assesses that any arrangements between us and the merchant-partners may be harmful to competition, the CCCS may take enforcement action against us that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In March 2024, a top official of CCCS identified digital markets as one of the CCCS's focus in the medium term. In July 2024, we terminated our proposed acquisition of Transcab Holdings Ltd and withdrew our CCCS merger approval application following the issuance of a provisional decision by CCCS that the proposed acquisition is likely to result in a substantial lessening of competition in the market for the supply of ride-hailing platform services to drivers and passengers in Singapore. The Philippine Competition Commission ('PCC') required a series of voluntary commitments from us in clearing our acquisition of Uber's Southeast Asian business in March 2018 and imposed a fine of approximately PHP 56.5 million (approximately $1.0 million) on us for violating some of our pricing and service quality commitments after the merger with Uber, which includes incentives monitoring to address lingering competition concerns. On January 15, 2023, the PCC issued an Incentives Monitoring Framework which was used by the PCC and a third-party monitor to assess all our existing and proposed new incentives, benefits, promotions, or rewards for our driver-partners or operators, to ensure that they do not have an anti-competitive effect. The Incentives Monitoring Framework was subsequently amended to make it consistent with our voluntary commitments. The assessment was conducted by a third-party monitor based on data submitted for the monitoring period from May 1, 2023 until October 31, 2023. The PCC appointed the third-party monitor on August 23, 2023. We raised an issue with the PCC on the impartiality of the appointed monitor considering that one of its officers is closely related to one of our known critics, and the PCC ultimately acceded to our request to appoint an impartial monitor. We are currently negotiating with the PCC on the monitoring of extended commitments. However, the PCC refused to vacate the appointment. Depending on the PCC's assessment and conclusion based on the monitor's findings, we may be prohibited from implementing planned incentives, or fined for having implemented incentives that are found to be anti-competitive. Also, on August 30, 2022 the Philippine Court of Appeals issued an adverse decision against us and Uber for alleged violations of interim measures previously ordered by the PCC, which decision became final on February 16, 2024. While this is subject to further proceedings before the PCC, if affirmed, the PCC may impose an additional PHP 12 million (approximately $200,000) in fines and penalties. The Malaysian Competition Commission ('MyCC') issued a proposed decision in October 2019 alleging that we had abused our dominant position in the ride-hailing booking and transit media advertising market through the imposition of a number of restrictive clauses on the driver-partners, including restrictions on driver-partners promoting competitors' products and providing advertising services to third-party enterprises. Pursuant to the proposed decision, MyCC proposed a fine of approximately MYR86.8 million (approximately $19.4 million) and a daily fine of MYR15,000 (approximately $3,000) for each day we fail to take the remedial actions as directed by MyCC. The penalty is imposed in the event of failure to comply with the interim directions ('Proposed Decision Directions'). We believe we have complied with the said Proposed Decision Directions and should not be subject to the daily fines. We at the same time have initiated a judicial review application against MyCC. In July 2023, the High Court held in favor of us, including an order to quash the Proposed Decision, including the proposed fines. In August 2023, MyCC filed a Notice of Appeal to appeal against the High Court's decision at the Court of Appeal. On March 19, 2025 the Court of Appeal is set to decide on the MyCC's appeal to challenge the High Court's ruling to quash the MyCC's proposed decision to impose the fine on us. In Thailand, the Trade Competition Commission Thailand ('TCCT') has placed increased scrutiny on the online deliveries and mobility markets by actively examining complaints submitted to it in relation to business operators' compliance with the local competition law. Indonesia's competition authority, the Business Competition Supervisory Commission ('KPPU'), has recently been enforcing Law No. 20 of 2008 regarding Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises dated July 4, 2008 ('Law No. 20/2008'), which regulates the fairness of partnerships between large and medium enterprises on the one side and small and micro enterprises on the other. In November 2024, KPPU started to investigate our partnership arrangements with our driver-partners for the delivery fee of GrabExpress and GrabFood in Indonesia. While we are committed to addressing any issues that KPPU may raise during investigation, we cannot predict whether the outcome will have any impact on our business.

Antitrust regulators in certain Southeast Asian countries where we operate are also reviewing their framework and policies to deal with digital markets. In addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations that we plan to make or re-evaluate previous acquisitions, combinations, or restructuring completed by us in the past, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. For example, our pricing model, including dynamic pricing, could be challenged or limited in emergencies and capped in certain jurisdictions or become the subject of litigation and regulatory inquiries. As a result, we may be forced to change our pricing model in certain jurisdictions and in certain circumstances, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.

Our growing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the data sets used, and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment.

Our growing use of AI (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks. This technology presents a number of risks inherent in its use. AI algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information, which can create inaccurate or discriminatory outcomes. AI algorithms may use third-party AI with unclear intellectual property rights or interests. Intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, of generative and other AI output, have not been fully interpreted by courts or regulations. The United States and other countries may consider comprehensive legal compliance frameworks specifically for AI, which is a trend that may increase now that the European Commission has proposed the first such framework. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. AI use or management by us or others, including decisions based on automated processing or profiling, inappropriate or controversial data practices, or insufficient disclosures regarding machine learning and algorithms, have and could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other harm, such as negative impacts to the value of our intellectual property or our brand. These and other deficiencies could also undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. The rapid evolution of AI may require us to allocate additional resources to help implement AI ethically in order to minimize unintended or harmful impacts, and may also require us to make additional investments in the development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models or other systems, which may be costly.

## Unfavorable media coverage could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects .

We are the subject of regular media coverage. Unfavorable publicity regarding, among other things, our business model or offerings, user support, technology, platform changes, platform quality, privacy or security practices, regulatory compliance, financial or operating performance, accounting judgments, management team, or public communications made by us or related parties could adversely affect our reputation. Such negative publicity could also harm the size of our network and the engagement and loyalty of consumers and driver- and merchant-partners that utilize our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Negative publicity could also draw regulator attention and lead to regulatory action or new laws or regulations impacting our business. In addition, the foregoing risks are increased by the widespread use of social media and the increasing incidence of fake or unsubstantiated news, particularly on social media and other online platforms.

As our platform continues to scale and public awareness of our brand increases, any future issues that draw media coverage could have an amplified negative effect on our reputation and brand. In addition, negative publicity related to key brands or influencers that we have partnered with may damage our reputation, even if the publicity is not directly related to us.

## We rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential driver-partners and they may fail to provide accurate information.

All potential driver-partners are required to go through our security and safety screening background checks before being qualified as a driverpartner on our platform. We rely on third-party background check providers to provide the criminal and/or driving records of potential driver-partners in most of our markets to help identify those that are not qualified to use our platform pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent such providers do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations, or the requirements of applicable laws or regulations. If any of our third-party background check providers terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame, which in turn could lead to difficulty in onboarding sufficient numbers of driver-partners to meet consumer or merchant-partner demand. Further, if the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise meet our expectations, unqualified drivers may be permitted to conduct passenger trips or make deliveries on our platform, and as a result, we may be unable to adequately protect or provide a safe environment for consumers and merchant-partners. Inaccurate background checks may also result in otherwise qualified drivers from being inadvertently excluded from our platform. Our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. In addition, if the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers do not meet the requirements under applicable laws and regulations, we could face legal liability or negative publicity.

## Table of Contents

We are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing driver-partners that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected, and we could face legal action. In addition, background check qualification processes may be limited in certain jurisdictions based on national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility.

Any negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to safety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## Our company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our business could be materially and adversely affected.

We believe that our company culture, which was founded on the principle of creating a triple bottom line business by delivering financial performance and social impact at the same time and promoting the values of heart, hunger, honor and humility, has been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:

- · staying true to our values and withstanding competitive pressures to move in a direction that may divert us from doing so;
- · maintaining appropriate alignment between our values and the fiduciary duties that our directors have under Cayman Islands law to act in the best interests of the company;
- · failure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share our values;
- · negative perception of our treatment of employees, consumers or driver- and merchant-partners; and
- · maintaining our culture while integrating new personnel and businesses as we grow.

If we are not able to maintain and evolve our culture, we may suffer consequences such as the inability to attract employees, consumers, driver and merchant-partners and business partners and maintain and grow our business, and as a result our financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.

We depend on talented, experienced and committed personnel, including engineers, to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to recruit, train, motivate and retain qualified personnel, particularly in the technology sector, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.

A fundamental driver of our ability to succeed is our ability to recruit, train and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in high demand, are often subject to competing employment offers and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Our senior management, mid-level managers and technology sector employees, including engineers, data scientists and analysts, cybersecurity specialists, product managers and designers are instrumental in implementing our business strategies, executing our business plans and supporting our business operations and growth. There is particularly acute competition for the technology sector and research and development employees in some of our markets. In addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel. Our executive officers and their involvement in our business are important to our success. Any decrease in the involvement of any of the executive officers in our business or loss of key personnel, particularly to competitors, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personnel transitions has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person's skills, knowledge of our business, and years of industry experience. Although our employment contracts contain non-compete clauses, there is the risk that such non-compete clauses may be deemed unenforceable under applicable law.

## Table of Contents

To attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures, which may not be sufficient to attract and retain the personnel we require to operate our business effectively. As demand in the technology sector intensifies, we may be required to offer more in terms of cash or equity in order to attract and retain talent, which would increase our expenses. The equity incentives we use to attract, retain, and motivate employees may not be effective, particularly if the value of the underlying stock does not increase commensurate with expectations or consistent with our historical growth. In addition, in certain countries, the grant of equity incentive may be restricted, preventing us from delivering such incentives to personnel in the respective country. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train and integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to attract and retain high-quality management and operating personnel, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.

Our ability to recruit and retain talent at desired compensation levels could also be limited by government attitudes and policies, which at times may favor nationals of the country in which we do business rather than hiring talent from abroad, which could impact our talent pool and the costs associated with it. If any pandemic, epidemic or disease outbreak were to arise, travel and other restrictions that governments may impose to curb transmission could harm our ability to recruit and retain talent, and may require significant numbers of employees to work remotely, which may impact productivity. Our ability to recruit and retain talent and maintain good relations with our employees could also be impacted by employee activism over social, political or other matters, which could impact our relations with our employees.

## Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit the ability to operate our business.

We have been in the past, are currently, and may be in the future, involved in private actions, collective actions, class actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by driver- and merchant-partners, consumers, employees, commercial partners, competitors, or government agencies, among others, relating to, for example, personal injury or property damage cases, wrongful act, subrogation, employment or labor-related disputes such as wrongful termination of employment, consumer complaints, disputes with driver-partners and merchant-partners, contractual disputes with consumers or suppliers, disputes with third parties and regulatory inquiries or proceedings relating to compliance with competition and data privacy regulations. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and may be expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. Furthermore, we may be held jointly responsible for claims against third parties offering their services through our platform, including driver- or merchant-partners. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into any settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users and driver- and merchant-partners, and in certain markets include other provisions such as mediation provisions or, in Singapore, for certain disputes to be referred to the Small Claims Tribunal. These provisions are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process for all parties involved, as arbitration or other methods of alternative dispute resolution can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigation in court. However, arbitration or other methods of alternative dispute resolution may become more costly for us, or the volume of cases may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we may voluntarily limit our use of arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings.

## Table of Contents

In December 2018, we were assessed approximately PHP 1.4 billion (approximately $24.2 million) in the Philippines for an alleged deficiency in local business taxes. We are contesting this assessment and our case remains under review by the regional trial court. In 2023, the PCC imposed a fine of PHP 6 million (approximately $104,000) on us for supposedly violating three separate Commission orders to return PHP 25.45 million (approximately $440,000) to the customers and imposed another fine of PHP 3 million (approximately $52,000) for providing incorrect and misleading information in the compliance reports that have been submitted with respect to the said refund orders. For additional details of certain legal proceedings involving us, see 'Item 8. Financial Information-A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information-Legal Proceedings.' Any such disputes or future disputes could subject us to negative publicity, have an adverse impact on our brand and reputation, divert management's time and attention, involve significant costs and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We may also be exposed to securities litigation. See '-Risks Relating to the Company's Securities-We and certain of our current and former directors or officers are, and in the future may be, subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.'

## We use debt to fund our business and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business .

As of December 31, 2024, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $206 million. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, we may incur additional indebtedness, secure existing or future indebtedness, or refinance our indebtedness. In particular, we may need to incur additional indebtedness to finance our operations and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms, or at all. Among other macroeconomic factors, an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our ability to secure additional debt financing and would result in higher interest payments.

We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. With the increases in interest rates since 2022, we have had to pay increased interest on our indebtedness, although we managed to mitigate such increases through capital management and the use of interest rate derivatives. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. While we currently generate net cash from operating activities, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to do so or that such amounts will be sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.

Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity. Further, any downgrade of our credit ratings may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional debt financing or may increase the cost thereof.

## Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs could adversely affect us.

Factors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs may increase the costs incurred by the driver-partners when providing services on our platform. Similarly, factors such as inflation, increased food costs, increased labor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant-partner operating costs. Many of the factors affecting driver- and merchant-partner costs are beyond the control of these parties and us. Russia's continued military actions in Ukraine since early 2022 and the resulting sanctions imposed by various governments on Russia have resulted in fuel price increases in certain countries in which we operate, which would increase the costs incurred by our driver- and merchant-partners. The Israel-Hamas war that started in October 2023 and reached a cease-fire agreement in January 2025 also drove up fuel prices. In many cases, these increased costs may cause driver-partners to spend less time providing services on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchant-partners to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices. The resulting increased prices may in turn reduce demand for the services offered on our platform. A decreased supply of driver- and merchant-partners or increased prices on our platform could reduce consumer demand, which would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## We may experience fluctuations in our operating results.

Our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, our revenue is typically lower in the first quarter of each year as a result of regional holidays, including the lunar new year and the holiday periods during which demand for mobility offerings is typically lower. In addition, our revenue is also impacted by other holidays such as Christmas and celebration of the new year as well as the fasting month of Ramadan, which impacts demand for deliveries and mobility offerings as well as driver-partner supply. Our operating results may also experience seasonal fluctuations due to weather conditions, such as flooding during the rainy season in certain markets, like Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this annual report. Furthermore, our fast-paced growth has made, and may in the future make, these fluctuations more pronounced and as a result, harder to predict. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results.

## We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

We operate in multiple jurisdictions, which exposes us to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We earn revenue denominated in Singapore Dollars, Indonesian Rupiah, Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Vietnamese Dong and Philippine Pesos, among other currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will affect our financial results, which we report in U.S. Dollars. We have entered into certain hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity may not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We cannot assure you that movements in foreign currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods. Furthermore, the substantial majority of our revenue is denominated in emerging markets currencies. Because fluctuations in the value of emerging markets' currencies are not necessarily correlated, there can be no assurance that our results of operations will not be adversely affected by such volatility.

## Table of Contents

We track certain operating metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our operating metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.

We track certain key operating metrics, including, among others, our GMV, MTUs, partner incentives, consumer incentives, registered driverpartners and cohort data, with internal systems and tools that are not independently verified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used. For example, the accuracy of our operating metrics could be impacted by fraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even though this is prohibited in our Terms of Service and we implement measures to detect and prevent this behavior. Consumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the number of consumers on our platform. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if investors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, we expect that our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.

Our use of 'open source' software under restrictive licenses could: (i) adversely affect our ability to license and commercialize certain elements of our proprietary code base on the commercial terms of our choosing; (ii) result in a loss of our trade secrets or other intellectual property rights with respect to certain portions of our proprietary code; and (iii) subject us to litigation and other disputes.

We have incorporated certain third-party 'open source' software ('OSS') or modified OSS into elements of our proprietary code base in connection with the development of our platform. In general, this OSS has been incorporated and is used pursuant to 'permissive' OSS licenses, which are designed to be compatible with our use and commercialization of our own proprietary code base. However, we have also incorporated and use some OSS under restrictive OSS licenses. Under these restrictive OSS licenses, we could be required to release to the public the source code of certain elements of our proprietary software which: (i) incorporate OSS or modified OSS in a certain manner; and (ii) have been conveyed or distributed to the public, or which the public interacts with. In some cases, we may be required to ensure that such elements of our proprietary software are licensed to the public on the terms set out in the relevant OSS license or at no cost. This could allow competitors to use certain elements of our proprietary software on a relatively unrestricted basis, or develop similar software at a lower cost. In addition, open source licensors generally do not provide warranties for their open source software, and the open source software may contain security vulnerabilities that we must actively manage or patch. It may be necessary for us to commit substantial resources to remediate our use of OSS under restrictive OSS licenses, for example by engineering alternative or work-around code. There is an increasing number of opensource software license types, and the terms under many of these licenses are unclear or ambiguous, and have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and therefore, the potential impact of such licenses on our business is not fully known or predictable. As a result, these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our own proprietary code (and in particular the elements of our proprietary code which incorporates OSS or modified OSS). Furthermore, we could become subject to lawsuits or claims challenging our use of open source software or compliance with open source license terms. If unsuccessful in these lawsuits or claims, we may face IP infringement or other liabilities, be required to seek costly licenses from third parties for the continued use of third-party IP, be required to re-engineer elements of our proprietary code base (e.g., for the sake of avoiding third-party IP infringement), discontinue or delay the use of infringing aspects of our proprietary code base (such as if re-engineering is not feasible), or disclose and make generally available, in source code form, certain elements of our proprietary code.

More broadly, the use of OSS can give rise to greater risks than the use of commercially acquired software, since open source licensors usually limit their liability in respect of the use of the OSS, and do not provide support, warranties, indemnifications or other contractual protections regarding the use of the OSS which would ordinarily be provided in the context of commercially acquired software.

Any of the foregoing could adversely impact the value of certain elements of our proprietary code base, and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights in such code base against third parties. In turn, this could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## Our business is subject to concentration risks.

Our deliveries, mobility, financial services and others segments represented 53.4%, 37.4%, 9.1% and 0.1% respectively, of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2024, 55.5%, 36.9%, 7.5% and 0.1%, respectively, of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023, and 50.5%, 44.9%, 4.5% and 0.1%, respectively, of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022. Over 90% of our revenue was derived from our deliveries and mobility segments in the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, to the extent demand for deliveries and/or mobility offerings are impacted by adverse events, changes in laws or regulations, driver- and merchant-partner supply or consumer-demand based factors, a significant portion of our business could be adversely impacted. As a result of our business concentration in our deliveries and mobility segments, adverse developments with respect to such segments could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage provided by third parties, and we are subject to the risk that this may be insufficient or that insurance providers may be unable to meet their obligations.

Our business depends heavily on (i) insurance coverage for driver-partners and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business, and (ii) the driver-partners' ability to procure and maintain insurance required by law. We maintain a large number of insurance policies, including, but not limited to, general liability, workers' compensation, property, cybersecurity and information risk liability, errors and omissions liability, and director and officers' liability. If our insurance providers change the terms of our policies in an adverse manner, our insurance costs could increase, and if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for additional costs. Additionally, if any of our insurance providers become insolvent, we would be unable to pay any claim that we make.

For example, we or the regulators require driver-partners to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases, we also maintain insurance on behalf of driver-partners. We rely on a limited number of insurance providers, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we, on behalf of driver-partners, would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. If we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed. We also face risks with respect to our insurance coverage in countries where our business is not yet subject to specific regulations.

We may also be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by the driver- or merchant-partners. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of driver- or merchant-partners or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## An increase in the use of credit and debit cards may result in lower growth or a decline in the use of our e-wallet.

Due to the underdevelopment of the banking industry in Southeast Asia, a significant portion of the population in these markets does not have access to credit or debit cards. In addition, many may be unwilling to use debit or credit cards for online transactions due to security concerns. Through the GrabPay wallet, consumers can make payments through our superapp. However, if the banking industry in Southeast Asia continues to develop and there is a significant increase in the availability, acceptance and use of credit cards or debit cards for online or offline payments by consumers in Southeast Asia, usage of our e-wallet could decline.

## Our reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles or changes in business model.

The accounting for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the evolution of our business model, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in SEC or other agency policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations of accounting regulations. Changes to our business model and/or accounting policies could result in changes to our financial statements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result in materially different financial results, and may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and our financial reporting controls. For example, our revenues increased by $68 million and cost of revenue increased by $68 million in fourth quarter of 2022 due to a business model change for certain delivery offerings in one of our markets from being an agent arranging for delivery services to be provided by our driver-partners to end-users, to being a principal whereby we are the delivery service provider contractually responsible for the delivery services provided to end-users.

## We allow consumers to pay for rides, deliveries and other offerings or services through our platform using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns.

We allow consumers to use cash to pay the driver-partners the entire fare of rides and cost of deliveries (including the service fee payable to us by driver-partners from such rides and deliveries). Cash-paid trips accounted for 27% of our transactions in 2024, 25% in 2023 and 27% in 2022. The use of cash raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, cash collection in some jurisdictions may fall into an ambiguous area between regulated banking or payments activity that requires licenses and activity that is not regulated by relevant law, which creates uncertainty. Failure to comply with regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in regulators requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash can increase safety and security risks for the driver-partners, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, there have been reported serious safety incidents, including robberies and violent attacks on driver-partners while they were using our platform. We have undertaken steps to minimize the use of cash by working with governments on initiatives to drive cashless penetration, providing consumer incentives such as coupons, vouchers or our rewards program to encourage use of GrabPay. In addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may continue to mean that we cannot collect the entire fee for certain cash-based transactions. We have created systems for driver-partners to collect and deposit the cash received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not always effective, convenient, or widely-adopted. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to a variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism laws. If driver-partners fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems fail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such collection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## We may be affected by governmental economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations that apply to Myanmar.

We may be affected by economic and trade sanctions administered by governments relating to Myanmar, including the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United Nations. For example, in response to the military coup in Myanmar in February 2021, the United States, the European, and the United Kingdom have implemented various sanctions and restrictions. These measures target specific individuals and entities, including military and security services, commercial entities, government officials and related persons who support the military, repress the pro-democracy movement in Myanmar, and/or commit violence against citizens, among other things. The sanctions include prohibitions on transactions, asset freezes, travel bans, among others. There are also restrictions on exports and reexports to Myanmar, and in-country transfers, of certain sensitive items. The United States, the European Union, and the United Kingdom and other countries or international organizations may impose additional sanctions in the future. Continued geopolitical tensions as well as existing and any additional sanctions could result in a material adverse impact on Myanmar's economy. While our operations in Myanmar represent less than one percent of our revenue, our future prospects in Myanmar could be adversely affected and we may need to exit the market, which would involve costs related to such exit and a loss of our investment in the market. There is a risk that, despite the internal controls we have in place, we have engaged or could potentially engage in dealings with persons sanctioned under applicable sanctions laws. Any non-compliance with economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations or related investigations in Myanmar could result in claims or actions against us and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## Our business could be impacted by environmental regulations and policies and related changes in consumer behavior and any failure on our part to meet our environmental, social and corporate governance ('ESG') targets.

Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate may implement regulations and policies aimed at addressing climate change or other environmental concerns including, among others, with respect to emission reduction and higher electrification of the automotive industry, as well as those limiting the use of single-use packaging and utensils. For instance, the Singapore Government has announced the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which sets out a series of targets pertaining to the environment and sustainable development. Among other targets, the Singapore Green Plan provides that new registrations of diesel cars and taxis will cease from 2025, and all new car and taxi registrations are required to be of cleaner-energy models (such as electric, hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell cars) from 2030. The cost of regulatory compliance for internal combustion engine vehicles could increase or governments may take action to reduce the number of internal combustion engine vehicles on the road. Although we have taken measures to increase the proportion of low emission vehicles in our fleet of rental vehicles, government policies or regulations may be implemented quickly. The foregoing could (i) increase costs for us, including with respect to changes in regulations, policies and operations, (ii) require us to purchase new vehicles for or increase costs with respect to our rental fleet, and (iii) create challenges for driver-partners as we may raise costs with respect to vehicle ownership or rental. In addition, we may have to incur additional cost for compliance with regulations with respect to, and operating, a fleet of electric vehicles. Furthermore, our business could be impacted by increased environmental awareness among consumers, for example with respect to the usage of single-use packaging and utensils or mobility or deliveries services generally.

In addition, investors increasingly focus on how companies assess and manage ESG risks and factor ESG into their investment selection criteria. We have publicly committed to meeting certain ESG targets. Failure to comply with environmental regulations and policies or to meet our ESG commitments may reduce our attraction for investors or prevent them from investing in us under their policies, hence impacting our ability to raise funds.

## Risks Relating to Our Corporate Structure and Doing Business in Southeast Asia

## In certain jurisdictions, we are subject to restrictions on foreign ownership.

The laws and regulations in many markets in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia where we conduct our business, place restrictions on foreign investment in, control over, management of, ownership of and ability to obtain licenses for entities engaged in a number of business activities. Set forth below is certain information with respect to foreign ownership restrictions relevant to our businesses in these jurisdictions. For more information, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - Regulatory Environment' and 'Item 4. Information on the Company - C. Organizational Structure.'

## Table of Contents

## Thailand

Pursuant to the Thai Foreign Business Act B.E. 2542 (1999) (the 'FBA'), a person or entity that is 'Non-Thai' (as defined in the FBA and described in 'Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - Regulatory Environment - Thailand') cannot conduct certain restricted businesses in Thailand, including the businesses that our entities in Thailand operate, unless an appropriate license is obtained. In addition, the Civil and Commercial Code of Thailand (as amended) at the time we incorporated our Thai entities required a private company to have a minimum number of three shareholders, although starting from February 7, 2023, a private company in Thailand is only required to have two shareholders. Our deliveries, mobility and financial services businesses are each conducted through a Thai operating entity established using a tiered shareholding structure, so that each Thai entity is more than 50% owned by a Thai person or entity. As our entities in Thailand are more than 50% owned by Thai persons or entities and Thai laws only consider the immediate level of shareholding (and no cumulative or look-through calculation is applied to determine the foreign ownership status of a company when it has several levels of foreign shareholding), these Thai operating entities are considered Thai entities under the FBA and are not required under the FBA to obtain licenses prescribed thereunder. Under the FBA, it is also unlawful for a Thai national or entity to hold shares in a Thai company as a nominee for or on behalf of a foreigner in order to circumvent the foreign ownership restrictions. While there are no prescribed requirements or criteria under the FBA or promulgated by the Ministry of Commerce of Thailand for determining whether a Thai national or entity is holding shares in a Thai company with his or her own genuine investment intent or as a nominee for or on behalf of a foreigner, the relevant authorities may follow certain guidelines, but generally may exercise discretion in making such a determination.

Under this tiered shareholding structure, our Thai operating entities (except for the newly incorporated Thai operating entity intended to operate an insurance brokerage business) are each owned by Grabtaxi Holdings (Thailand) Co., Ltd., which owns 75% of the shares of our Thai operating entities, with the balance owned by one of our subsidiaries. Grabtaxi Holdings (Thailand) Co., Ltd. is owned by a Thai entity ('Thai Holding Entity 1') holding over half of the shares of Grabtaxi Holdings (Thailand) Co., Ltd. (with the balance primarily owned by one of our subsidiaries). Thai Holding Entity 1 is in turn owned by another Thai entity ('Thai Holding Entity 2') holding over half of the shares of Thai Holding Entity 1 (with the balance primarily owned by one of our subsidiaries). Thai Holding Entity 2 is held by a Thai national holding preference shares equivalent to more than half of the total number of shares of Thai Holding Entity 2 (with the balance primarily held by our subsidiary holding ordinary shares equivalent to slightly less than half of the total number of shares of Thai Holding Entity 2). For more information, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company - C. Organizational Structure.' Pursuant to the organizational documents of Thai Holding Entity 2, our rights, which include the quorum for a shareholders meeting requiring our attendance and all shareholder resolutions requiring our affirmative vote, enable us to control our Thai operating entities and consolidate the financial results of these operating entities in our financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The preference shares of Thai Holding Entity 2 have limited rights to the return of liquidation proceeds upon the liquidation of the companies. The preference shares of Thai Holding Entity 1 have limited rights to dividends and distributions. We have also set up three other Thai holding entities adopting a similar tiered shareholding structure (with a slight difference in shareholding percentages) for the purposes of primarily holding our Thai operating entity intended to conduct an insurance brokerage business.

## Vietnam

Pursuant to the Law on Investment No. 61/2020/QH14, as amended in 2022 and 2024 (the 'Investment Law 2020') and the Schedule of Specific Commitments in Services in Vietnam's Commitments to the WTO, our four-wheeled mobility business in Vietnam is subject to a foreign ownership limit of 49%. Our deliveries and mobility businesses in Vietnam are conducted through a Vietnamese operating company, the shares of which are owned 49% by us, with the balance 51% held by a Vietnamese national who is a senior executive of Grab Vietnam. Through the voting thresholds in the charter and contractual arrangements with this Vietnamese shareholder, we are able to control our Vietnamese operating entity and consolidate our financial results in our financial statements in accordance with IFRS.

## Table of Contents

## Philippines

Pursuant to the 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines, entities engaged in the operation of a public utility are required to be at least 60% owned by Philippine citizens. Our four wheel-deliveries and mobility businesses, which are subject to this restriction, are conducted through Philippine operating entities, the shares of which are each owned by a Philippine holding company, which owns 60% of the shares of the Philippine operating entities, with the balance owned by our subsidiaries. The shares of the Philippine holding company are 40% legally and/or beneficially owned by us, with the balance 60% of the shares held by an entity owned by a Philippine national who is a director of certain of our operating entities in the Philippines, including MyTaxi.PH, Inc. Through contractual arrangements with the Philippine shareholder (and, together with certain rights attendant to the classes of shares in, and as otherwise set forth in the organizational documents of, the Philippine holding company), we are able to (i) appoint directors in proportion to our shareholding interest, (ii) exercise veto rights with respect to certain reserved matters that fundamentally affect the business of the company, (iii) receive the economic benefits and absorb losses of the Philippine entities in proportion to the amount and value of our investment, (iv) have an exclusive call option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in the event of any change in Philippine law that results in non-Philippine nationals being allowed to hold more than 40% of the outstanding capital stock or shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of entities engaged in nationalized activities, and (v) consolidate the financial results in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The non-controlling interest of the Philippine shareholder is accounted for in our consolidated financial statements.

On March 21, 2022, the President of the Philippines signed into law Republic Act No. 11659, which amended the Public Service Act (the 'PSA Amendment') and became effective in the following month. The PSA Amendment limits the definition of public utility to a public service that operates, manages, or controls for public use any of the following: (i) distribution of electricity; (ii) transmission of electricity; (iii) petroleum and petroleum products pipeline transmission systems; (iv) water pipeline distribution systems and wastewater pipeline system, including sewerage pipeline systems; (v) seaports; and (vi) public utility vehicles (but excluding transport vehicles accredited with and operating through transport network corporations such as TNVSs). The PSA Amendment provides for an exclusive enumeration of what constitutes a public utility, and states that '[n]o other person shall be deemed a public utility unless otherwise subsequently declared by law.' The PSA Amendment also expressly provides that 'notwithstanding any law to the contrary, nationality requirements shall not be imposed by the relevant administrative agencies on any public service not classified as a public utility.' Under the PSA Amendment, the 40% nationality restriction previously applicable to our ride sharing and express delivery business in the Philippines no longer applies.

However, to the extent that we are engaged in an advertising business in the Philippines, we remain subject to foreign ownership restrictions. Under the Philippine Constitution, only Philippine citizens or corporations or associations with at least 70% of the capital stock owned by Philippine citizens are allowed to engage in advertising. In addition, the participation of foreign investors in the governing body of companies engaged in advertising is limited to their proportionate share in the capital stock thereof, and all the executive and managing officers of such entities must be Philippine citizens.

## Indonesia

Our payment system services business is conducted through PT Bumi Cakrawala Perkasa ('BCP'), an Indonesian entity which owns OVO. OVO is subject to an 85% foreign investment limit (based on ultimate beneficial ownership of shares) pursuant to a payment system regulation which took effect on July 1, 2021. Under this regulation, a voting power limitation of 49% applies to foreign shareholders, and foreign shareholders are prohibited from holding (i) the right to nominate the majority of directors and commissioners, and (ii) veto rights with respect to certain strategic decisions that have a significant impact on the company to be adopted at a general meeting of shareholders. We own 82.8% of BCP, which, due to a dual-class structure, represents a 38.9% voting interest, and we also have contractual rights to (a) control the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer (including the right to nominate any such officers as directors or as president director), (b) approve the budget and business plan of BCP and its subsidiaries; (c) approve future funding of BCP and its subsidiaries, whether through debt, equity or otherwise, and (d) certain economic rights with respect to the remaining shareholding of BCP. If the foregoing contractual rights are considered to be foreign controlled, BCP could be deemed to be in non-compliance with the foreign investment limit and, as a result, Bank Indonesia may impose administrative sanctions on OVO (including, among others, warnings, temporary suspension or suspension of a part of or the entire business activity (including any cooperation) and, if OVO does not take any action with regard to these administrative sanctions, it may lead to revocation of the e-money license. If revocation of the e-money license happens, OVO's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely impacted. We consolidate BCP's financial results in our financial statements in accordance with IFRS. If we are required to amend the shareholding, voting structure or other rights as a foreign shareholder with respect to BCP, we may be prevented from continuing to consolidate OVO in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, BCP may be limited in its ability to receive cash contributions for additional equity and we may be limited in our ability to acquire shares in BCP and if Indonesian shareholders or parties are unwilling to make such contributions, OVO's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely impacted.

In addition, we conduct our point-to-point courier delivery business through PT Solusi Pengiriman Indonesia ('SPI'), in which a 94.12% owned subsidiary owns 49%. We have entered into contractual arrangements with a third-party Indonesian shareholder, which holds 51% of the shares of SPI, as a result of which we are able to control SPI and consolidate its financial results in our financial statements in accordance with IFRS.

## Malaysia

Our supermarkets business is subject to the Guidelines on Foreign Participation in Distributive Trade Services in Malaysia (2022) issued by the Malaysian Ministry of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living, which stipulate a maximum foreign voting cap of 50% for smaller retail formats (non-superstores) in Malaysia. Accordingly, 50% of the ordinary shares in Jaya Grocer are held by an entity ('Malaysian local partner') owned by a Malaysian national who is our employee. We, through a wholly owned subsidiary, have entered into a management agreement with Jaya Grocer and the Malaysian local partner that generally entitles us to decide, among others, on business and financial strategies, including funding, and other strategy matters in relation to the business of Jaya Grocer, in the best interest of Jaya Grocer and in consultation with the Malaysian local partner. Our economic ownership of Jaya Grocer is reflected through our ownership of its preference shares which entitles us to 75% of the economic interest in Jaya Grocer.

Based on our assessment as of the date of this annual report, we believe our arrangements in Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia, other than as set forth above, if any, are in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations. However, local or national authorities or regulatory agencies in any of Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia or Malaysia may conclude that our arrangements in their respective jurisdictions are in violation of local laws and regulations.

If authorities in any of Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia or any other countries in which we may establish similar arrangements in the future believe that our ownership of, or arrangements with respect to, relevant entities do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, including requirements, prohibitions or restrictions on foreign investment in our lines of business or with respect to necessary registrations, permits or licenses to operate our businesses in such jurisdictions, they would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations or failures, including imposing civil or criminal sanctions or financial penalties against us, deeming our arrangements void by law and requiring us to restructure our ownership structure or operations, revoking our business licenses and/or operating licenses, prohibiting payments from and funding to our entities or ordering us to cease our operations in the relevant jurisdiction. The foregoing could also result in the inability to consolidate the financial results of relevant entities in our financial statements in accordance with IFRS.

## Table of Contents

In addition, to the extent there are disagreements between us and our partners, counterparties or holders of equity or other interests, or any of their associated persons such as a holder's spouse or other family members, with respect to relevant entities, including the business and operation of these entities, we cannot assure you that we will be able to resolve such matters in a manner that will be in our best interests or at all. These persons may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations, whether of a financial nature or otherwise, have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, take actions contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies and objectives, take actions that are not acceptable to regulatory authorities, or experience financial difficulties. Actions taken by governmental authorities or disputes between us and our partners, counterparties or holders of equity or other interests, or any of their associated persons could cause us to incur substantial costs in defending our rights.

## We are subject to risks associated with operating in the rapidly evolving Southeast Asia, and we are therefore exposed to various risks inherent in operating and investing in the region.

We derive all of our revenue from our operations in countries located in Southeast Asia, and we intend to continue to develop and expand our business and penetration in the region. Our operations and investments in Southeast Asia are subject to various risks related to the economic, political and social conditions of the countries in which we operate, including risks related to the following:

- · inconsistent and evolving regulations, licensing and legal requirements may increase our operational risks and cost of operations among the countries in Southeast Asia in which we operate;
- · currencies may be devalued or may depreciate or currency restrictions or other restraints on transfer of funds may be imposed;
- · the effects of inflation and interest rate hikes within Southeast Asia generally and/or within any specific country in which we operate may increase our cost of operations;
- · governments or regulators may impose new or more burdensome regulations, taxes or tariffs;
- · political changes may lead to changes in the business, legal and regulatory environments in which we operate;
- · economic downturns, political instability, civil disturbances, war, military conflict, religious or ethnic strife, terrorism and general security concerns may negatively affect our operations;
- · enactment or any increase in the enforcement of laws, rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, those related to personal data protection and localization, cybersecurity and ESG, may incur compliance costs, in particular where there is uncertainty around the interpretation, implementation, or applicability of such laws, rules and regulations;
- · health epidemics, pandemics or disease outbreaks may affect our operations and demand for our offerings; and
- · natural disasters like volcanic eruptions, floods, typhoons and earthquakes may impact our operations severely.

For example, volatile political situations in certain Southeast Asian countries may impact our business. In Myanmar, after the military coup in February 2021, there have been ongoing instability disrupting our business activities in the country, and the situation may deteriorate further, In the Philippines, we expect that there will be a more politicized environment leading up to the 2025 midterm national and local elections. . Any disruptions in our business activities or volatility or uncertainty in the economic, political or regulatory conditions in the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, global geopolitical uncertainty has heightened, which may have spillover effects in Southeast Asia and materially and adversely impact our business.

Additionally, the laws in the countries in which we operate may change and their interpretation and enforcement may involve significant uncertainties that could limit the reliability of the legal protections available to us. We cannot predict the effects of future developments in the legal regimes in the countries in which we operate.

Any of the foregoing risks may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## Our businesses may be materially and adversely affected by any changes or negative developments in the economic and political environments in any regions of Southeast Asia as well as globally.

We derive all of our revenue from Southeast Asia and are exposed to economic and political uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks of war, terrorism, nationalism, changes in interest rates, imposition of capital controls and methods of taxation that affect consumer confidence, consumer spending, loan default rates, payment or deposit patterns and levels, consumer discretionary income or changes in consumer purchasing habits. Given the interconnectedness of different economies, our business could be impacted to a significant extent by economic and political conditions in Southeast Asia as well as globally.

Substantially all of our assets and operations are located in Southeast Asia, and our revenue in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and the rest of Southeast Asia was $643 million, $816 million, $265 million, $578 million, $252 million, $228 million and $15 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, respectively, $605 million, $673 million, $200 million, $480 million, $205 million, $185 million and $11 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, and $275 million, $509 million, $125 million, $302 million, $109 million, $108 million and $5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. As a large portion of our revenue in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was derived from our operations in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced to a significant degree by economic, political and other conditions in Southeast Asia generally, and in particular, in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The economies in certain Southeast Asian countries differ from most developed markets in many respects, including the level of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange, government policy on public order and allocation of resources. In some of the Southeast Asia markets, governments continue to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. Moreover, some local governments also exercise significant control over the economic growth and public order in their respective jurisdictions through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency denominated obligations, setting monetary policies, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.

While the Southeast Asia economy, as a whole, has experienced significant growth over past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in Southeast Asia or in other markets in neighboring regions (such as China and Japan), or in the policies of the governments or of the laws and regulations in each respective market could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of Southeast Asia. Such developments could adversely affect our business and operating results, lead to reduction in demand for our offerings and adversely affect our competitive position. Many of the governments in Southeast Asia have implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over foreign capital investments or changes in tax regulations. Some Southeast Asia markets have historically experienced low growth in their Gross Domestic Product, significant inflation and/or shortages of foreign exchange. We are exposed to the risk of rental and other cost increases due to potential inflation and interest rate rises in the markets in which we operate. In the past, some of the governments in Southeast Asia have implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustments, currency trading band adjustments and exchange rate controls, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in Southeast Asia, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, some Southeast Asia markets have experienced, and may in the future experience, political instability, including strikes, demonstrations, protests, marches, coups d'état, guerilla activity or other types of civil disorder. These instabilities and any adverse changes in the political environment could increase our costs, increase our exposure to legal and business risks, disrupt our office operations or affect our ability to expand our user base.

## Uncertainties with respect to the legal system in certain markets in Southeast Asia could adversely affect us.

The interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations involve uncertainties and inconsistencies. Since local administrative and court authorities and in certain cases, independent organizations, have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we may enjoy in many of the localities in which we operate. Moreover, local courts may have broad discretion to reject enforcement of foreign awards. These uncertainties may affect our judgment on the relevance of legal requirements and our ability to enforce our contractual rights or tort claims. In addition, the regulatory uncertainties may be exploited through unmerited or frivolous legal actions or threats in attempts to extract payments or benefits from us.

## Table of Contents

It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in Southeast Asia and elsewhere that could restrict our business segments. Scrutiny and regulation of the business segments in which we operate may further increase, and we may be required to devote additional legal and other resources to addressing these regulations. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in Southeast Asia or elsewhere regarding our business segments may slow the growth of our business segments and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## We could face uncertain tax liabilities in various jurisdictions where we operate, and suffer adverse financial consequences as a result.

Our management believes we are in compliance with all applicable tax laws, including filing of tax returns and paying taxes, in the various jurisdictions where we are subject to tax, but our tax liabilities could be uncertain, and we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if tax authorities do not agree with our interpretation of the applicable tax laws.

Although GHL is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, we collectively operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and pay income taxes according to the tax laws of these jurisdictions. Various factors, some of which are beyond our control, determine our effective tax rate and/or the amount we are required to pay, including changes in or interpretations of tax laws in any given jurisdiction and changes in geographical allocation of income. We accrue income tax liabilities and tax contingencies based upon our best estimate of the taxes ultimately expected to be paid after considering our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, existing tax laws, our experience with previous audits and settlements, the status of current tax examinations and how the tax authorities view certain issues. Such amounts are included in income taxes payable or deferred income tax liabilities, as appropriate, and are updated over time as more information becomes available.

In addition, we may, from time to time, be subject to inquiries or audits from tax authorities of the relevant jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challenges to positions asserted on income and withholding tax returns. We cannot be certain that the tax authorities will agree with our interpretations of the applicable tax laws, or that the tax authorities will resolve any inquiries in our favor. To the extent the tax authorities do not agree with our interpretation, we may seek to enter into settlements with the tax authorities which may require significant payments and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. We may also appeal against the tax authorities' determinations to the appropriate governmental authorities, but we cannot be sure we will prevail. If our appeal does not prevail, we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges (or reduce tax assets) that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Similarly, any adverse or unfavorable determinations by tax authorities on pending inquiries could lead to increased taxation on us, that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and may also impact our reputation, including but not limited to tax and other regulatory authorities in Southeast Asia.

In December 2022, 2023 and 2024, we received protective tax assessments from the Singapore tax authorities for financial years 2017 to 2019 pertaining to the tax treatments of certain expenses and associated transfer pricing arrangements. We have been reviewing this matter with the Singapore tax authorities and have accrued income tax liabilities based upon our best estimate of the taxes ultimately expected to be paid after considering our knowledge of relevant facts and circumstances. To the extent that any tax assessments arising from tax audits, including the preceding example, are material, we intend to seek all possible legal recourse to defend our positions, but there can be no assurance that such recourse would be successful.

In addition, over the last decade, there have been concerted efforts among government tax policymakers around the world to strengthen international cooperation on taxation matters, to stamp out harmful practices and combat tax avoidance by multinational enterprises ('MNEs'). These efforts have included the G20/Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion Profit Shifting ('BEPS'), which has been continually evolving to develop an agreement on a 'two-pillar' approach, as described below, to help address tax avoidance, ensure coherence of international tax rules, and, ultimately, a more transparent tax environment. The current project, referred to as BEPS 2.0, has the following two elements:

- · Pillar One on new nexus and profit allocation rules with the objective of assigning a greater share of taxing rights over global business income to the country of the location of the customers, and

## Table of Contents

- · Pillar Two rules on a new global minimum tax of 15%, approved in December 2021 by more than 140 jurisdictions participating in the BEPS 2.0 project.

We adopt a hyper-local model, whereby our operating subsidiaries earn and book in-country income and pay income taxes according to the tax laws of local jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions all have corporate income tax rates above 15%. In this context, we generally believe that BEPS 2.0 should have a limited financial impact on us. That said, such tax reform legislation has recently been enacted, implemented or is being proposed in a few of the jurisdictions we operate in. We will continue to assess whether such laws could increase our tax obligations in these markets or change the manner in which we operate our businesses locally, and any adverse impact to our business and financial condition will be addressed readily.

## Natural events, wars, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence directly or indirectly impacting any of the countries in which we have operations could adversely affect our operations.

Natural disaster events (such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods, droughts, heat waves, tropical weather conditions and landslides), terrorist attacks, civil unrest, protests and other acts of violence or war (such as the wars that broke out in Ukraine in early 2022 and in the Middle East in 2023) may adversely disrupt our operations, lead to economic weakness in the countries in which they occur and affect worldwide financial markets, and could potentially lead to economic recession, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These events could precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events also pose significant risks to our people and to our business operations. In particular, one of our largest markets is Indonesia. Indonesia is located in a geologically active part of the world, and has been subject to various forms of natural disasters that have in the past resulted in major losses of life and property and could result in disruptions to our business.

## Risks Relating to the Company's Securities

## The trading prices of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants have been, and may continue to be, volatile.

The trading prices of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants have been, and may continue to, fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation:

- · changes in the industries and countries in which we operate;
- · developments involving our competitors;
- · changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses;
- · variations in our operating performance and financial condition, as well as the performance of our competitors in general;
- · actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating and financial results;
- · publication of research reports by securities analysts about us or our competitors or our industry;
- · the public's reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and filings with the SEC concerning our company or our securities;
- · actions by shareholders, including any sale by major shareholders, other significant shareholders or our directors and officers;
- · short seller reports that make allegations against us or our affiliates, even if unfounded;
- · departures of key personnel;
- · commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;
- · any share repurchases made by us;
- · changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;
- · the volume of our Class A Ordinary Shares available for public sale; and

## Table of Contents

- · general economic and political conditions, such as recessions, inflation, interest rates, local and national elections, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations, corruption, political instability and acts of war or terrorism.

These market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants regardless of our operating performance.

## Sales of a substantial number of our securities in the public market by our existing securityholders could cause the price of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants to fall.

Sales of a substantial number of Class A Ordinary Shares and/or Warrants in the public market by the existing securityholders, or the perception that those sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants. See also '-Future resales of our Ordinary Shares issued to our shareholders and other significant shareholders may cause the market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.'

## We may issue additional securities without shareholder approval in certain circumstances, which would dilute existing ownership interests and may depress the market price of our shares.

We require significant capital investment to support our business, and we may issue additional Class A Ordinary Shares, Class B Ordinary Shares convertible into Class A Ordinary Shares or other equity or convertible debt securities of equal or senior rank in the future without approval of the holders of the Class A Ordinary Shares in certain circumstances, including as consideration for strategic acquisitions such as we did with a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of a majority economic interest in Jaya Grocer and with respect to the share exchanges discussed below.

Our issuance of additional Class A Ordinary Shares, Class B Ordinary Shares convertible into Class A Ordinary Shares, or other equity or convertible debt securities of equal or senior rank would have the following effects: (i) our existing shareholders' proportionate ownership interest in us may decrease; (ii) the amount of cash available per share, including for payment of dividends in the future, may decrease; (iii) the relative voting power of each previously outstanding Class A Ordinary Share may be diminished; and (iv) the market price of Class A Ordinary Shares may decline. Under certain circumstances, each Class B Ordinary Share will automatically convert into one Class A Ordinary Share (as adjusted for share splits, share combination and similar transactions occurring), but as the conversion ratio is one-to-one, such mandatory conversion would not have a dilutive effect.

## Table of Contents

In addition, certain strategic partners have swapped or have the right to swap the shares they hold in our subsidiaries for Class A Ordinary Shares. In July and December 2024, PT Elang Mahkota Teknologi Tbk. and Porto Worldwide Limited, an affiliate of Central Group, exercised their one-time right to swap all of their shares in certain subsidiaries of our group for approximately 1.9% and 1.0%, respectively, of our total outstanding shares as of February 15, 2025. With respect to the Digital Banking JV, based on terms agreed but not yet effective pending the satisfaction of various conditions precedent, we expect that our joint venture partner would not be entitled to exchange its shares in the Digital Banking JV for our shares until at least December 2027 and that any such share exchange would be based upon a formula that considers the then prevailing valuation of the Digital Banking JV and the trading price of Class A Ordinary Shares at the time of the exchange, both of which are not possible to predict with any degree of certainty at this time. For illustrative purposes, however, while there can be no assurance that any proposed share exchange will be agreed with respect to the Digital Banking JV, in the event a proposed share exchange takes place where the number of Class A Ordinary Shares to be received by the joint venture partner were determined by dividing the valuation of the joint venture partner's stake in the Digital Banking JV by the trading price of Class A Ordinary Shares and assuming a share price of $10 per Class A Ordinary Shares at the time of closing of such transaction, the joint venture partner would, for every $1 billion of valuation of our stake in the Digital Banking JV (determined at the time of the closing of such transaction), be entitled to 100 million Class A Ordinary Shares, which would be equivalent to 2.5% of Ordinary Shares (based on the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding as of February 15, 2025). Given that the value of the Digital Banking JV and any Class A Ordinary Shares to be issued to our joint venture partner in connection with the Digital Banking JV will not be determined for at least until December 2027, the number of Class A Ordinary Shares that may be issued to our joint venture partner may differ materially from the foregoing and could be materially greater and could represent a significantly higher percentage than 2.5% of Ordinary Shares for each $1 billion of valuation of such joint venture partner's stake in the Digital Banking JV, thereby resulting in materially greater dilution to our shareholders. In addition, employees, directors and consultants of our company and our subsidiaries and affiliates hold and are granted equity awards under the 2021 Plan and purchase rights under the ESPP. You will experience additional dilution when those equity awards and purchase rights become vested and settled or exercised, as applicable, for Ordinary Shares. See 'Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-B. Compensation-Share Incentive Plans.'

## If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, publish inaccurate or unfavorable research or cease publishing research about us, our share price and trading volume could decline significantly.

The trading market for our Class A Ordinary Shares will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We may be unable to sustain coverage by well-regarded securities and industry analysts. If either none or only a limited number of securities or industry analysts maintain coverage, or if these securities or industry analysts are not widely respected within the general investment community, the demand for our Class A Ordinary Shares could decrease, which might cause our share price and trading volume to decline significantly. In the event that we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade their assessment or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the market price and liquidity for our Class A Ordinary Shares could be negatively impacted.

## A certain number of our Warrants have become exercisable for our Class A Ordinary Shares, which would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our shareholders.

Our Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 10,000,000 Class A Ordinary Shares have become exercisable in accordance with the terms of the Assignment, Assumption and Amendment Agreement and the Existing Warrant Agreement governing those securities. The exercise price of these warrants is $11.50 per share. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional Class A Ordinary Shares will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of our Class A Ordinary Share and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market or the fact that such warrants may be exercised could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares.

## Table of Contents

Future resales of our Ordinary Shares issued to our shareholders and other significant shareholders may cause the market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.

Pursuant to our Shareholder Support Agreements and Sponsor Support Agreement, certain of our shareholders were or are restricted, subject to certain exceptions, from selling certain of our securities that they received as a result of the share exchange in the Business Combination. As of the date of this annual report, the sale restrictions on all the relevant securities have expired and have become eligible for resale in accordance with U.S. securities laws, including Rule 144. In addition, certain of our shareholders and certain other significant shareholders may avail of the registration statements on Form F-3 (File Number: 333-261949 and 333-264872) which we filed pursuant to our agreements with them, or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 'Securities Act'), to sell large amounts of our securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, which could have the effect of increasing the volatility in our share price or putting significant downward pressure on the price of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants.

The warrant agreement (the 'Warrant Agreement') governing the Warrants designates the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of the Warrants, which could limit the ability of Warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us in connection with such Warrants.

The Warrant Agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the Warrant Agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We have waived any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the Warrant Agreement do not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any Warrants under the Warrant Agreement shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions of the Warrant Agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the Warrant Agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a 'foreign action') in the name of any holder of the Warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an 'enforcement action'), and (y) having service of process made upon such holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such holder's counsel in the foreign action as agent for such holder. The choice-of-forum provision limits a Warrant holder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of the Warrant Agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.

## The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert our management's attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.

We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act'), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, NASDAQ Global Select Market listing requirements and other applicable securities rules and regulations. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. To improve our reporting standards and compliance, we have invested significant costs in building our internal team while strategically engaging external consultants to enhance maturity in our SOX program. As our business grows, we anticipate the scope of our compliance activities and related costs to increase gradually year on year.

## Table of Contents

Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We expect these laws and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to render some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty.

Many members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. The need to maintain and improve the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert the management's attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, as compared to being a private company, these rules and regulations generally make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and consequently we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These additional obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating committee, and qualified executive officers.

As a result of disclosure of information in this annual report and in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition is more visible than private companies, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and, even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could cause an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and reputation.

## If we are unable to maintain an effective system of internal controls and compliances, our business and reputation could be adversely affected.

As a U.S. public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements under the U.S. securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. See 'Item 15. Controls and Procedures.' Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

However, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from NASDAQ, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods. If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could in turn limit our access to capital markets, harm our financial condition and results of operations, and lead to a decline in the market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants.

## We qualify as a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to United States domestic public companies.

Because we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and regulations in the United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including: (i) the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC; (ii) the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents, or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act; (iii) the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their share ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and (iv) the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.

## Table of Contents

We are required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we have published and intend to continue to publish our results on a quarterly basis through press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Press releases relating to financial results and material events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC are less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. Accordingly, you may receive less or different information about us than you would receive about a U.S. domestic public company.

We could lose our status as a foreign private issuer under current SEC rules and regulations if more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities become directly or indirectly held of record by U.S. holders and any one of the following is true: (i) the majority of our directors or executive officers are U.S. citizens or residents; (ii) more than 50% of our assets are located in the United States; or (iii) our business is administered principally in the United States. If we lose our status as a foreign private issuer in the future, we will no longer be exempt from the rules described above and, among other things, will be required to file periodic reports and annual and quarterly financial statements as if we were a company incorporated in the United States. If this were to happen, we would likely incur substantial costs in fulfilling these additional regulatory requirements and members of our management would likely have to divert time and resources from other responsibilities to ensure these additional regulatory requirements are fulfilled. See 'Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-C. Board Practices-Foreign Private Issuer Status.'

As a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, we are permitted to adopt certain home country practices in relation to corporate governance matters that differ significantly from NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards applicable to domestic U.S. companies. These practices may afford less protection to shareholders than they would enjoy if we complied fully with NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards.

We are a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands and are listed on NASDAQ. NASDAQ market rules permit a foreign private issuer like us to follow the corporate governance practices of our home country. Certain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is our home country, may differ significantly from NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards applicable to domestic U.S. companies.

Among other things, we are not required to have: (i) a majority-independent board of directors; (ii) a compensation committee consisting of independent directors; (iii) a nominating committee consisting of independent directors; or (iv) regularly scheduled executive sessions with only independent directors each year. In addition, we are not required to have our shareholders approve certain issuances of securities, including those in connection with the establishment of or material amendments to equity compensation plans or arrangements.

Although not required and as may be changed from time to time, we have a majority-independent board of directors, a majority-independent compensation committee and a nominating committee. Subject to the foregoing, we rely on the exemptions listed above. As a result, you may not be provided with the benefits of certain corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ applicable to U.S. domestic public companies. See 'Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-C. Board Practices-Foreign Private Issuer Status.'

You may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through U.S. courts may be limited, because we are incorporated under the law of the Cayman Islands, and because we conduct substantially all of our operations, and a majority of our directors and executive officers reside, outside of the United States.

We are an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and we conduct a majority of our operations through our subsidiary, GHI, and GHI's subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities outside the United States. Substantially all of our assets are located outside the United States. A majority of our officers and directors reside outside the United States and a substantial portion of the assets of these individuals are located outside of the United States. As a result, it could be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals outside of the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed upon under the applicable securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Cayman Islands and of jurisdictions outside the United States could render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers.

## Table of Contents

Our management has been advised that Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam, where we principally operate, do not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with the United States. Further, it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the United States and Southeast Asia markets would permit effective enforcement of criminal penalties of U.S. federal securities laws.

In addition, the corporate affairs of GHL are governed by its amended and restated articles of association (the 'Amended Articles'), the Cayman Islands Companies Act (Revised) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from the common law of England, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding, on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors under Cayman Islands law may not be as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws than the United States. Some U.S. states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the Cayman Islands. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the United States.

Shareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies like us have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records (other than the memorandum and articles of association) or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of these companies. Our directors will have discretion under the Amended Articles to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders, but we are not obliged to make them available to the shareholders. This may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest.

Certain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is our home country, differ significantly from requirements for companies incorporated in other jurisdictions such as the United States. To the extent that we choose to follow home country practice with respect to corporate governance matters, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than they otherwise would under rules and regulations applicable to U.S. domestic issuers. See 'Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-C. Board Practices-Foreign Private Issuer Status.'

As a result of all of the above, our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a company incorporated in the United States.

## We and certain of our current and former directors or officers are, and in the future may be, subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.

The market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have been and may be the target of this type of litigation and investigations. Beginning in March 2022, various putative shareholder class action lawsuits were filed against our Company and certain of its officers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On June 7, 2022, the Court appointed Lead Plaintiffs and consolidated all actions under the caption In re Grab Holdings Limited Securities Litigation, No. 1:22-cv-02189-VM. On August 22, 2022, Lead Plaintiffs filed an Amended Class Action Complaint against the Company, certain of its officers and directors, and certain officers and directors of Altimeter Growth Corp. The class action is purportedly brought on behalf of various classes of persons who allegedly suffered damages as a result of alleged misstatements and omissions regarding our proxy and registration statements, business operations, potential impact on our financial results, and future prospects, in violation of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 14(a), and 20(a) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. On November 18, 2022, the Company and the other defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint. Briefing on the motion to dismiss was completed on February 27, 2023. On March 12, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants' motion to dismiss. On January 13, 2025, the Court granted preliminary approval of a settlement agreement for $80 million. The Company expects a portion of the cost of settlement will be covered by applicable litigation insurance policies. Moreover, involvement in securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.

## The ability of our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities in certain Southeast Asia markets to distribute dividends to us may be subject to restrictions under their respective laws.

We are a holding company, and our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities are located throughout Southeast Asia in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia. Part of our primary internal sources of funds to meet our cash needs will be our share of the dividends, if any, paid by our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities. The distribution of dividends to us from the subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities in these markets as well as other markets where we operate is subject to restrictions imposed by the applicable laws and regulations in these markets. In addition, although there are currently no foreign exchange control regulations which restrict the ability of our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities in Indonesia (save for the regulations prohibiting the transfer of Indonesian Rupiah to outside of Indonesia and imposing reporting requirements on foreign exchange transactions in excess of a certain amount), Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines (except for the regulations (i) requiring registration of the foreign investment with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas ('BSP') to be able to source from the Philippine banking system foreign currency to be used in repatriating capital or remitting dividends outside the Philippines, and (ii) prohibiting the transfer of Philippine Pesos to outside of the Philippines in excess of PHP 50,000 (approximately $860) without prior written authorization from the BSP) to distribute dividends to us, the relevant regulations may be changed and the ability of these subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities to distribute dividends to us may be restricted in the future.

## We do not anticipate paying dividends for the foreseeable future. Our share repurchase program may not be fully consummated and may not enhance long-term shareholder value.

We expect to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Our board of directors has complete discretion as to whether to distribute dividends. Even if the board of directors decides to declare and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on the future results of operations and cash flow, capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by us from subsidiaries and our consolidated affiliated entities, our financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors. There is no guarantee that our shares will appreciate in value or that the trading price of the shares will not decline.

In February 2024, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $500 million worth of our Class A Ordinary Shares. As of the date of this annual report, pursuant to this program, we have repurchased and cancelled a total of 67 million Class A Ordinary Shares with an aggregate principal amount of $226 million. We may continue to repurchase up to $274 million worth of our Class A Ordinary Shares. The share repurchase program does not have a fixed end date and does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Additionally, it may be suspended or terminated at any time. The share repurchase program may not enhance long-term shareholder value. The share repurchase program and the related share repurchases, if any, could affect the prices of our Class A Ordinary Shares and/or Warrants and increase their volatility. Furthermore, share repurchases may diminish our cash reserves, which could affect our operating results and financial condition.

## We have granted in the past, and we will also grant in the future, share incentives, which may result in increased share-based compensation expenses.

In March 2018, GHI's board of directors adopted and GHI's shareholders approved the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2018 Plan, which was amended and restated in April 2019 and further amended in April 2021, for the purpose of granting share-based compensation awards to employees, directors and consultants to incentivize their performance and align their interests with us. No further awards will be granted under the 2018 Plan. However, in April 2021 in connection with the Business Combination, our board of directors adopted, and our shareholders approved the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2021 Plan, which was amended and restated in September 2021 and in November 2023. The maximum number of ordinary shares that may be issued under the 2021 Plan is seven percent (7%) of the total number of our Ordinary Shares that were outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) as of December 1, 2021, plus the number of ordinary shares that remained available for grant under the 2018 Plan immediately prior to December 1, 2021, subject to a potential annual increment every year starting on January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2031. The 2021 Plan permits the awards of options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units, or RSUs, and other awards to employees, directors and consultants of our company and our subsidiaries and affiliates, which we recognize as compensation expenses in our consolidated statements of profit or loss in accordance with IFRS. In addition, in April 2021, our board of directors and our shareholders approved the 2021 Equity Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2021 ESPP, under which initially the maximum number of shares that may be issued is two percent (2%) of the total number of our Ordinary Shares that were outstanding as of December 1, 2021, subject to a potential annual increment every year starting on January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2031. As a result of the awards under the 2021 Plan and the subscription of Class A Ordinary Shares under the 2021 ESPP, we incurred share-based compensation expense of $279 million, $304 million and $412 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For more information on the share incentive plans, see 'Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-B. Compensation-Share Incentive Plans.' We believe the granting of share-based compensation is of significant importance to our ability to attract and retain key personnel and employees, and as such, we will also grant share-based compensation and incur share-based compensation expenses in the future. As a result, expenses associated with share-based compensation may increase, which may have an adverse effect on us and our business and results of operations.

## Our dual-class voting structure may limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any change of control transactions that holders of our Class A Ordinary Shares may view as beneficial.

Our authorized and issued ordinary shares are divided into Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares. Each Class A Ordinary Share is entitled to one vote, while each Class B Ordinary Share is entitled to 45 votes. Only Class A Ordinary Shares are listed and traded on NASDAQ, and we intend to maintain the dual-class voting structure. The Key Executives and their respective Permitted Entities hold all of the outstanding Class B Ordinary Shares.

The proxies given to Mr. Tan by the other Key Executives and certain entities related to such Key Executives or Mr. Tan under the Shareholders' Deed (the 'Key Executive Proxies') and the proxies given to Mr. Tan by our executive officers other than Mr. Tan under the Voting Proxy Deeds (the 'Exco Proxies') give Mr. Tan control of the voting power of all outstanding Class B Ordinary Shares. As a result, as of February 15, 2025, after giving effect to the Key Executive Proxies and the Exco Proxies, Mr. Tan controlled approximately 63.4% of the total voting power of all issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class, even though he and his Permitted Entities only beneficially owned 3.7% of outstanding Ordinary Shares. For further information, see 'Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions-B. Related Party Transactions-Shareholders' Deed.' and 'Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions-B. Related Party Transactions-Voting Proxy Deeds.'

With respect to the election of the board of directors, under the terms of the Class B Ordinary Shares, holders of a majority of the Class B Ordinary Shares have the right to nominate, appoint and remove a majority of the members of our board of directors, which majority are designated as Class B Directors. As of February 15, 2025, Mr. Tan and his Permitted Entities owned approximately 76.5% of the total issued and outstanding Class B Ordinary Shares (without taking into account Class B Ordinary Shares that may be acquired pursuant to awards under our share incentive plans). As a result of such ownership, as well as the Key Executive Proxies and the Exco Proxies, Mr. Tan effectively has the right to nominate, appoint and remove all of the Class B Directors. In addition, since all of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class will elect the remaining members of our board of directors, then Mr. Tan, by virtue of his control of approximately 63.4% of that total voting power as of February 15, 2025 (after giving effect to the Key Executive Proxies and the Exco Proxies), effectively has the ability to elect and remove the entire board of directors.

## Table of Contents

Additionally, the Key Executives and certain entities related to the Key Executives entered into a letter agreement (the 'ROFO Agreement'), pursuant to which, subject to certain limited exceptions, in the event any holder of Class B Ordinary Shares intends to sell or otherwise transfer Class B Ordinary Shares in an open market or private transaction, that transferring shareholder first shall irrevocably offer those shares to each other holder of Class B Ordinary Shares by way of a notice delivered to each such other holder. Each recipient holder then has a right of first offer to purchase any or all of those shares at a price per share equal to the market price (as defined in the ROFO Agreement) of the Class A Ordinary Shares (into which those shares would automatically convert if sold in an open market or private transaction to other purchasers). The recipients of the right of first offer generally shall have three business days within which to exercise such right, which shall be allocated pro rata among exercising recipients if the total of all shares exercised exceed the total amount of shares to be transferred. In March 2025, all of our executive officers (other than Mr. Tan) entered into a joinder agreement, pursuant to which they agreed to be a party to, and be fully bound by, all of the covenants, terms and conditions of the ROFO Agreement with respect to any and all Class B Ordinary Shares that they hold as if they were parties thereto, except that each of them waived their right of first offer to purchase any Class B Ordinary Shares held by any other person. The ROFO Agreement has the effect of providing Class B Ordinary Shareholders the right to preserve the continued ownership of Class B Ordinary Shares within that group of holders except the executive officers other than Mr. Tan. Since all of those holders delivered the Key Executive Proxies and given the Exco Proxies, the ROFO Agreement also will have the effect of preserving Mr. Tan's control over the Class B Ordinary Shares and our company as discussed herein.

## Risks Relating to Taxation

There can be no assurance that we will not be a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes for any taxable year, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders.

A non-U.S. corporation will generally be classified as a passive foreign investment company ('PFIC') for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income or (ii) at least 50% of the value of its assets (generally determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income (the 'asset test'). Passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and gains from the disposition of passive assets. In addition, a non-U.S. corporation will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which it owns, directly or indirectly, 25% or more (by value) of the stock.

Based upon the value of our assets and the composition of our income and assets, including goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, we do not believe we were a PFIC for our taxable year ended December 31, 2024. No assurances can be given with regard to our PFIC status for our current or subsequent taxable years because our PFIC status is a factual determination made annually after the close of each taxable year that will depend, in part, on the composition of our income and assets. Because the value of our assets for purposes of the asset test may be determined by reference to the market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares from time to time (which may be volatile), fluctuations in the market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares may cause us to be or become a PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable years. Recent declines in the market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares significantly increased our risk of being or becoming a PFIC. The market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares may continue to fluctuate considerably and, consequently, we cannot assure you of our PFIC status for any taxable year. In addition, the composition of our income and assets will also be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets. As previously disclosed, we believed that we were a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, it is possible that one or more of our subsidiaries were also PFICs for U.S. federal income tax purposes for such taxable year.

If we or any of our subsidiaries is a PFIC for any taxable year, or portion thereof, that is included in the holding period of a beneficial owner of our Class A Ordinary Shares or Warrants that is a U.S. Holder (as defined in 'Item 10. Additional Information-E. Taxation-United States Federal Income Tax Considerations'), such U.S. Holder may be subject to certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and may be subject to additional reporting requirements. Further, if we are classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds our Class A Ordinary Shares or Warrants, we will generally continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder holds our Class A Ordinary Shares or Warrants, unless we were to cease to be a PFIC and such U.S. Holder were to make a 'deemed sale' election with respect to the Class A Ordinary Shares or Warrants. Please see the section entitled 'Item 10. Additional Information-E. Taxation-United States Federal Income Tax Considerations-Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations' and 'Item 10. Additional Information-E. Taxation-United States Federal Income Tax Considerations-Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules.' U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible application of the PFIC rules to holders of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants.

## Future changes to tax laws could materially and adversely affect us and reduce net returns to our shareholders.

Our tax treatment is subject to changes in tax laws, regulations, and treaties, or the interpretation thereof, tax policy initiatives and reforms under consideration, and the practices of tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. The income and other tax rules in the jurisdictions in which we operate are constantly under review by taxing authorities and other governmental bodies. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or our shareholders. We are unable to predict what tax proposals may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices, could affect our financial position and overall or effective tax rates in the future in countries where we have operations and where we or our subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities are organized or resident for tax purposes, and increase the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance. We urge investors to consult with their legal and tax advisers regarding the implication of potential changes in tax laws on an investment in Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants.

## ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY

## A. History and Development of the Company

We were first incorporated in July 2011 as MyTeksi Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian private limited company, and launched our mobility business in June 2012 in Malaysia with our taxi-hailing booking service MyTeksi.

In June 2013, GrabTaxi Holdings Pte. Ltd., a Singapore private limited company, was incorporated as the ultimate corporate parent of our subsidiaries, consolidated affiliated entities and other holdings (together, 'our group'). In April 2015, we conducted a holding company reorganization and incorporated Grab Inc., a Cayman Islands limited liability company, as the ultimate corporate parent of our group. In 2016, we rebranded from MyTeksi/GrabTaxi to Grab. In March 2018, Grab Inc. completed another holding company reorganization in which Grab Holdings Inc., or GHI, became the ultimate corporate parent of our group. In December 2021, the Business Combination was completed, upon which Grab Holdings Limited, or GHL, became the ultimate corporate parent of our group, and our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants are listed on NASDAQ under the symbols 'GRAB' and 'GRABW,' respectively.

## B. Business Overview

## Our Mission

Our mission is to drive Southeast Asia forward by creating economic empowerment for everyone. Our mission is supported by our core principles, which we refer to as the '4Hs,' Heart, Hunger, Honor, and Humility. These principles are set out in The Grab Way, which is a living document that guides our decision making and serves as a reminder of what is important and right as we work to serve Southeast Asia.

## Overview

## Southeast Asia's leading superapp

We are Southeast Asia's leading superapp, operating primarily across the deliveries, mobility and digital financial services sectors in over 800 cities across eight countries in the region-Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. We enable millions of people each day to access driver- and merchant-partners to order food or groceries, send packages, hail a ride or taxi, pay for online purchases or access services such as lending and insurance. Our platform enables important high frequency hyperlocal consumer services. As part of our financial services offerings, we also provide digital banking services through GXS Bank in Singapore and GXBank in Malaysia.

Our revenue was $2,797 million, $2,359 million and $1,433 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing year-over-year growth rates of 19% from 2023 to 2024 and 65% from 2022 to 2023. Our revenue in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and the rest of Southeast Asia was $643 million, $816 million, $265 million, $578 million, $252 million, $228 million and $15 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, respectively, $605 million, $673 million, $200 million, $480 million, $205 million, $185 million and $11 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, and $275 million, $509 million, $125 million, $302 million, $109 million, $108 million and $5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Our loss for the period was $158 million, $485 million and $1,740 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing year-over-year improvement of 67% from 2023 to 2024 and 72% from 2022 to 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $313 million, $(22) million and $(793) million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 1,597% from 2023 to 2024 and 97% from 2022 to 2023.

## Table of Contents

Our revenue growth in 2024 was driven by an increase in on-demand GMV and increased contributions from the financial services segment. Our revenue growth in 2023 and 2022 was driven by an increase in on-demand GMV and reduction in on-demand incentives as a percentage of on-demand GMV, particularly in 2023 as we optimized our partner and consumer incentive spend. Our on-demand GMV was $18.4 billion, $15.8 billion and $14.1 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing year-over-year growth rates of 16% from 2023 to 2024 and 12% from 2022 to 2023. On-demand incentives as a percentage of on-demand GMV were relatively stable in 2023 and 2024 at 9.9% and 10%, respectively, as compared to 13.3% in 2022. The level of incentives as a percentage of on-demand GMV in 2023 and 2024 reflects the strategic use of incentives to drive on-demand growth in our platform.

## The Strength of the Grab brand in Southeast Asia

Our brand is closely associated with quality, reliability, safety and convenience in the minds of the Southeast Asian consumers that seek to access services offered through our platform. Our strong brand has enabled us to maintain and grow our scale in Southeast Asia.

## Grab's Industry Opportunity

We believe that Southeast Asia is still undergoing rapid digitalization and that we are still in the early stages of capturing this opportunity in the region given the low digital penetration of food deliveries, mobility and digital payments.

Various drivers of social and economic change in Southeast Asia that we believe will serve as tailwinds to accelerate the adoption of digital services offered by Grab include:

- · Rapid urbanization driven by macroeconomic and demographic growth.
- · Mobile-first population with increasing digital engagement.
- · Increasing digitalization of services and consumption.
- · Regulatory landscape supportive of technology and digital advancement.
- · Large unbanked and underserved population.

## Consumers who use our platform

Our over 41 million monthly transacting users ('MTUs') in 2024 came from a wide range of demographics and socio-economic backgrounds. Consumers who use our platform are highly engaged and demand high-quality services, technological functionality, and prompt responsiveness.

## Our driver-partners

Our driver-partners represent a diverse range of individuals across many different ethnicities and age groups. Our driver-partners take pride in satisfying consumers by providing rides, food deliveries and package deliveries each day. Our driver-partner network is also highly inclusive. In 2024, more than 5,100 persons with disabilities performed at least one transaction on the Grab platform.

## Our merchant-partners

Our merchant-partners and Indonesian GrabKios agents range from local entrepreneurs, including small restaurants, convenience and grocery stores, to multinational franchises and lifestyle service providers, including hotels and travel agents.

## Our Triple Bottom Line

Grab strives to serve a triple bottom line-we aim to simultaneously deliver financial performance for our shareholders and have a positive social impact, which includes economic empowerment for millions of people in the region, while mitigating our environmental footprint.

## Table of Contents

We aim to deliver a positive social impact sustainably over the long-term. As we grow our business and our ecosystem, we create more earning opportunities for driver- and merchant-partners. We do this by improving efficiency (for example, by reducing driver-partners' wait time at stores), providing digital tools to expand their reach to customers, and supporting financial inclusion (such as providing cash advance to driver- and merchant-partners with limited access to capital). In 2024, 2023 and 2022, our driver- and merchant-partners earned a total of $12.8 billion, $11.0 billion and $10.6 billion through our platform, respectively.

We also leverage our technological capabilities and ecosystem to support solutions that help mitigate environmental impact in Southeast Asia. We have formed partnerships with automakers to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles in the region and enabled and encouraged consumers to contribute towards environmental causes through our in-app features such as default cutlery opt-out toggle, a carbon offset toggle, and options to prioritize low emission modes of transport (such as electric and hybrid vehicles). We also make efforts to optimize demand and routes to mitigate carbon emissions from partners' vehicles through order batching, ride-sharing (GrabShare and GrabHitch) and reducing pick-up distance.

In April 2021, we deepened our commitment towards long-term sustainability initiatives by creating the GrabForGood Fund, an endowment fund co-funded by Grab, our co-founders and external donors, which aims to support programs that deliver social and environmental impact for our partners and the communities in which we operate. Under the GrabForGood Fund, we have been running the GrabScholar program since 2022, providing underprivileged students with access to education through scholarships and bursaries.

We released our sustainability report for 2023, prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative ('GRI') standards, on June 5, 2024. We expect to release our sustainability report for 2024 in the second quarter of 2025. The contents of these reports are not included in this annual report, and shall not be deemed as part of this annual report.

## Our Offerings

The Grab ecosystem is a single, seamless platform brought to life through three superapps, one each for our driver- and merchant-partners and consumers. Together these superapps help our driver- and merchant-partners connect with millions of Southeast Asians consumers seeking hyperlocal services made available through our platform, which includes our deliveries, mobility and financial services offerings.

Deliveries -Our deliveries platform connects our driver- and merchant-partners with consumers to create a local logistics platform, facilitating on-demand and scheduled delivery of a wide variety of daily necessities including in selected markets, ready-to-eat meals and groceries, as well as point-topoint package delivery. We also operate supermarkets in Malaysia under Jaya Grocer, which enables us to bring the convenience of on-demand grocery delivery to more consumers in the country. We also work with merchant-partners to offer Dine Out Deals to Grab users, which enables them to offer discounts or vouchers directly to consumers when they dine in their restaurants. Through GrabAds, we also work with our merchant-partners to provide promoted listings and banner advertisements, enabling them to promote their businesses within the food and grocery delivery offerings on our platform and enhance their consumer reach.

Mobility -Our mobility offerings connect our driver-partners with consumers seeking rides across a wide variety of multi-modal mobility options including private cars, taxis, motorcycles in certain countries, and shared mobility options such as carpooling in selected markets. It also includes GrabRentals, which facilitates vehicle rental for our driver-partners to allow driver-partners (with otherwise limited vehicle access) to be able to offer services through our platform. Through GrabAds, we also provide both online and offline advertising solutions, with the latter leveraging our vehicle fleet, such as car wraps and incar product placements to generate mass awareness.

Financial Services -Our financial services offerings include digital solutions offered by and with our partners to address the financial needs of driver- and merchant-partners and consumers, including primarily digital payments, lending, receivables factoring, and insurance distribution through GrabFin and OVO. As part of our financial services offerings, we also provide digital banking services through GXS Bank in Singapore and GXBank in Malaysia. We also hold 30.84% equity interest in PT Super Bank Indonesia. As of December 2024, GXS Bank offers savings accounts, payment products (GXS Debit Card and GXS FlexiCard), and digital lending products (GXS FlexiLoan) to the public in Singapore. GXBank offers savings accounts, payment products (GX Bank Debit Card) and FlexiCredit, a revolving line of credit to the public in Malaysia.

Others -We have a growing suite of enterprise offerings including GrabMaps, our mapping and location-based service. In addition, our partners offer other lifestyle services to consumers through our superapp, including hotel bookings, subscriptions and more in certain countries.

The key to our platform is the relevance of our offerings to consumers' everyday lives from the time the consumer wakes up and orders breakfast, commutes to and from the workplace, all the way to the evening when the consumer orders dinner, pays for bills or shops online. We focus on everyday transactions such as transportation, eating, shopping, digital payments, banking and other financial services. At a touch of a button, consumers have access to all offerings on our platform through a single mobile application.

In a region as geographically diverse as Southeast Asia, the offerings on our platform have a wide geographic coverage, operating in capital cities, major commercial and tourist cities, as well as smaller cities and towns across Southeast Asia.

## Deliveries Offerings

Our deliveries platform connects our driver- and merchant-partners with consumers to create a local logistics platform, facilitating on-demand delivery of a wide variety of daily necessities including ready-to-eat meals and groceries, as well as point-to-point package delivery. We enable consumers to conveniently discover and place food and grocery delivery orders or pre-purchase dine-in vouchers, empower our merchant-partners to build an online presence, reach consumers and scale their business and provide our driver-partners with income opportunities outside of our mobility offerings. We also operate supermarkets in Malaysia under Jaya Grocer, which enables us to bring the convenience of on-demand grocery delivery to more consumers in the country.

## Mobility Offerings

The desire to bring safe and convenient mobility to Southeast Asia is how we got started as a company back in 2012. Our mobility offerings connect consumers with rides provided by driver-partners across a wide variety of multi-modal mobility options including private cars, taxis, motorcycles, and shared mobility options such as carpooling. Our mobility options are designed to provide safe, delightful and economical services for consumers using our platform while enabling economic empowerment for our driver-partners by providing flexibility to earn a living in ways best suited to their objectives.

Key mobility offerings on our platform include the following:

We provide both online and offline advertising solutions, with the latter leveraging our vehicle fleet, such as in-car product placements and mobile billboards to generate mass awareness.

## Financial Services Offerings

Using the wealth of data generated across our ecosystem of daily life use cases, we have built an analytical and risk management platform to provide our consumers, driver- and merchant-partners with a suite of financial services-which for many would likely be their first ever financial service product.

We have had a strong focus on fraud prevention and risk management technologies since our inception, which we believe provides us with an advantage in navigating the complexities of financial services in Southeast Asia. Our in-house proprietary anti-fraud technologies can be used to mitigate the risk of fraudulent activity including account takeovers. Furthermore, our AI-enabled credit scoring models seek to protect against anomalous and suspicious transactions, and efficiently assign credit scores to consumers.

We also have strategic partnerships with a number of local and regional banks in Southeast Asia to grow our business.

## Table of Contents

## Key financial services offerings on our platform include the following:

- · GrabPay is our digital payments solution addressing unique digital payments challenges and is available in Indonesia (through OVO), Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. It allows consumers to make online and offline electronic payments using their mobile wallet. We enable consumers, lacking access to a bank account, to add payment methods and top up their mobile wallet through our driver-partner network, amongst many other top up channels. It also allows our driver- and merchantpartners to receive digital payments for their services, allowing them access to serve a large consumer base and saving them the hassle and risk of having to handle cash payments.
- · GrabRewards is our loyalty platform providing consumers that use our platform with a large catalog of points redemption options, including offers from both popular merchant-partners and Grab. Integration with our offerings allows for a seamless experience, including automatic suggestions to pay for a ride or delivery using GrabRewards points (OVO Points in Indonesia).

## Others

Other offerings primarily include GrabMaps. GrabMaps is a Business-to-Business (B2B) enterprise offering that enables us to provide base map data and map-making tools and software-as-a-service.

Additionally, in pursuit of continuing to experiment with new offerings to better serve the needs of our driver- and merchant-partners and consumers, our platform also facilitates other lifestyle services through our superapp including attraction tickets and hotel bookings.

## Our Business Model

Our platform connects millions of consumers with millions of driver- and merchant-partners to facilitate interaction and trade between these stakeholders. We generate the majority of our revenue from service fees and commissions paid by driver- and merchant-partners for use of the Grab superapp to connect them with consumers and facilitate transactions. Based on service agreements with driver- and merchant-partners, we retain the applicable fee or commission from the fare or order and related charges that we collect on behalf of the driver- and merchant-partners.

We offer various incentives to our driver- and merchant-partners, which are deducted from the commissions and fees normally received from driver- or merchant-partners (typically being a percentage of the fare paid by the consumer to the driver- or merchant-partner) and such incentives may sometimes exceed Grab's commissions and fees from a particular transaction. We also offer consumer incentives. All of the foregoing incentives are recorded as reductions in revenue. We also generate revenue from payment processing services transaction fees charged to merchant-partners.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, there was a business model change in one of our markets for certain delivery offerings from being an agent arranging for delivery services provided by our driver-partners to end-users, to being a principal whereby we are the delivery service provider contractually responsible for the delivery services provided to end-users. Under the principal model, delivery fees paid by users in that market are recognized as revenue to us, and the amount from it that is paid to driver-partners to carry out the delivery, plus any additional incentives we pay to them, are recognized as an expense or cost of revenue by us.

Set forth below are descriptions of our business model by segment.

Deliveries . Our deliveries platform connects driver- and merchant-partners with consumers to create a localized logistics platform, facilitating ondemand and scheduled delivery of a wide variety of daily necessities, including ready-to-eat meals and groceries, as well as point-to-point package delivery. This segment includes GrabFood, GrabMart, Dine Out, GrabExpress, and GrabKios. Through GrabAds, we also work with our merchant-partners to provide promoted listings and banner advertisements, enabling them to promote their businesses within the food and grocery delivery offerings on our platform and enhance their consumer reach.

Consumer Economics: The consumer pays the total dollar value of goods ordered, delivery fee, and platform and other fees, which is partially offset by a promotion given. In the example above, the GMV of the consumer's delivery order is $27.60, consisting of the following components:

- · The dollar value of goods ordered: $24.00;
- · Delivery fee: $3.40; and
- · Platform and other fees: $0.20.

Merchant-partner Economics: We charge our merchant-partners a commission by applying an agreed-upon commission to the total dollar value of goods ordered. Merchant-partners receive the dollar value of goods ordered as well as any incentives, net of the Grab commission. In the example above, the merchant receives $20.00.

Driver-partner Economics: The driver-partners receive the delivery fee, and we may charge a commission in certain markets. In the example above, the driver-partner receives $4.60, which consists of the delivery fee and incentives.

Grab Economics: We retain the commission paid by merchant-partners and driver-partners. In the example above, we would retain $1.00 in total, of the $5.00, after accounting for partner incentives of $2.00 and consumer incentives of $2.00. Using the same example above, for one of our markets where a business model change was effected for certain delivery offerings from the fourth quarter of 2022 onwards, we would retain $5.60 in total as revenue, net of consumer and merchant-partner incentives, while delivery fees of $3.40 and driver-partner incentives of $1.20 would be recognized as cost of revenue.

Platform and Other fees: Platform fees are ultimately borne by the driver-partner for benefits that they receive from utilizing our offerings. We collect the platform fees from consumers on behalf of driver-partners which enables us to maintain and enhance safety measures, costs for platform improvements and support our driver-partner's welfare. Other fees include a small order fee which is the difference between the order amount and the minimum order quantity when the goods ordered are less than the specified minimum order amount.

## Table of Contents

Mobility. Our mobility offerings connect consumers with rides provided by driver-partners across a wide variety of multi-modal mobility options including private cars, taxis, motorcycles (in certain countries), and shared mobility options, such as carpooling. This segment includes GrabCar, GrabTaxi, JustGrab, GrabBike, three-wheel vehicles, GrabShare, and GrabRentals. Through GrabRentals, we utilize Grab's fleet of cars to provide one-stop car rental to driver-partners at affordable rates. Through GrabAds, we also provide both online and offline advertising solutions, with the latter leveraging our vehicle fleet, such as in-car product placements and mobile billboards to generate mass awareness.

The graphic below illustrates the economics of a typical ride:

| 52.60    |
| 5(1.00)  |
| 5(1 00)  |

Consumer Economics: The consumer pays the total dollar value of the ride, including any tolls (tolls are collected by us from the consumer and remitted directly to the driver-partner who paid for the initial toll), tips, and other platform fees, which is partially offset by an incentive given. In the example above, the consumer pays $13.00. The GMV of the consumer's ride is $14.00, consisting of the following components:

- · The dollar value of the ride: $13.00;
- · Tolls and other fees: $0.80; and
- · Platform fee: $0.20.

Driver-partner Economics: The driver-partner receives the value of the ride, including tolls and other platform fees, and incentives, net of the Grab commission or service fee. Commissions are based on an agreed-upon rate based on the cost of the ride, while the service fee varies depending on the distance travelled and time taken by our driver-partners to pick up a passenger. In the example above, the driver-partner earns $12.40.

<!-- image -->

## Table of Contents

Grab Economics: We retain the commission earned from the journey. In the example above, Grab earns $0.60 after accounting for partner incentives of $1.00 and consumer incentives of $1.00.

Financial Services . Our financial services offerings include digital solutions to address the financial needs of our driver- and merchant-partners and consumers, including primarily digital payments, lending, receivables factoring, and insurance. This segment includes GrabPay, GrabRewards, GrabFin, GrabInsure, and OVO. The financial results of OVO, which is a leading Indonesian digital payments and smart financial services business, are consolidated in our financial results and included in our financial services segment. As part of our financial services offerings, we also provide digital banking services through GXS Bank in Singapore and GXBank in Malaysia. As of December 2024, GXS Bank offers savings accounts, payment products (GXS Debit Card and GXS FlexiCard), and digital lending products (GXS FlexiLoan) to the public in Singapore. GXBank offers savings accounts, payment products (GX Bank Debit Card) and FlexiCredit, a revolving line of credit to the public in Malaysia.

Merchant-partners that have entered into contractual agreements with Grab pay us a commission fee, based on transaction volumes, to support the GrabPay e-wallet services we provide or facilitate for merchant-partners and consumers. Inter-company revenue generated from on-platform payments, together with the corresponding costs charged to other Grab segments, is eliminated when we consolidate our financial results. Consumer incentives and consumer rewards are recorded as reductions in revenue (and not as expense), and therefore in the past, we have recorded negative revenues from financial services for certain periods.

We also generate revenue from other financial services, namely lending, insurance, and others. For lending and receivables factoring, we generate revenue primarily based on the interest income we receive from the loans we extend to borrowers and from the factoring fee or discount when we purchase the receivables, as the case may be. For other financial services, we generate revenue through commissions received from the sale of products and services. We also maintain a rewards program, which helps to increase retention as consumers earn rewards points that can be redeemed on our platform.

Others. We have a growing suite of enterprise offerings that we are progressively making available to our driver- and merchant-partners, consumers and corporate clients. In addition, this segment includes other lifestyle services offered by third party service providers to consumers through the Grab app, including hotel bookings, subscriptions and more in certain countries.

We also launched GrabMaps in 2022. GrabMaps allows us to tap into the mapping and location-based services market opportunity. First developed for in-house use, GrabMaps was created to address our need for a more hyperlocal solution to power our services. Commercializing GrabMaps as a B2B solution includes offering GrabMap's base map data, enabling customers to leverage GrabMap's map-making tools and software-as-a-service.

For lifestyle offerings, we earn revenues from commissions charged to service providers in return for selling these services through our platform.

## The Grab Ecosystem

## Grab ecosystem flywheel

<!-- image -->

Our platform connects millions of consumers with millions of driver- and merchant-partners to facilitate interaction and trade amongst these stakeholders. The continuous interactions that occur on our platform among these participants, as well as between these participants and our platform, create a vibrant ecosystem, which is highly synergistic for our business. The impact of our flywheel includes:

## Encourage consumers and partners to use the Grab platform

More offerings and partners on our platform drive greater selection, better value, more bookings and faster delivery times, all of which, along with our incentives, encourage consumers to use the Grab platform more to access our mix of offerings.

Greater usage by consumers creates more income opportunities for our driver- and merchant-partners, which encourages more drivers and merchants to join our platform. This in turn expands our merchant-partner base and value for the consumers, while the increasing driver- and merchant-partner density results in faster delivery times and improved experience for the consumers, reinforcing the value proposition to consumers.

Our ecosystem drives significant synergistic benefits. More partners on our platform drive greater selection, better value, faster booking allocations and delivery times, all of which improve the consumers' experience on our platform and encourage greater usage.

Our financial services offerings help to further reduce transactional frictions by facilitating seamless transactions and providing additional opportunities for consumers to engage with partners in the ecosystem. The more activity there is on the platform, the more value we create for our stakeholders as our ecosystem grows.

## Integrated ads encourage more consumer spend and improve partner outcomes

Our superapp ecosystem allows merchant-partners and other enterprises to reach consumers with targeted messaging and offers via GrabAds. These GrabAds advertisers are able to use a variety of demand generation tools to reach Grab's consumers and convert them into customers, shrinking their marketing funnel with attributable campaign results.

Consumers discover these GrabAds advertisers seamlessly via personalized advertising and content while browsing the Grab superapp, and are nudged to engage and transact with these advertisers within the Grab ecosystem. As a result, consumers increase their transaction frequency and order sizes with these advertisers, leading to stronger consumer engagement, increased merchant sales, and thereby accelerating the Grab ecosystem flywheel.

## Table of Contents

GrabAds also offers integrated advertising solutions with our vehicle fleet, allowing advertisers to place advertising inside and outside of vehicles. Participating driver partners receive a portion of the advertising value, supplementing their income.

## Help achieve operational efficiencies

Our scale and ecosystem also spur growth and facilitate the rapid rollout of new offerings. Leveraging our existing base of driver-partners, we were able to rapidly scale our food delivery offering to become Southeast Asia's category leader in just two years. In addition, we were able to expand GrabMart from two countries to all of our eight Southeast Asian markets within three months in 2020. We also relaunched the enhanced Move It, our twowheel ride-hailing app in the Philippines, which has seen daily rides increase rapidly in the eight months following its launch. Not only are we able to rapidly scale our offerings, but we are able to do so at lower costs.

## Enhances resilience of our business model

Our platform is diversified and flexible. We facilitate important high-frequency everyday consumer services and cater to a wide range of price points and demographics, enabling us to remain present throughout consumers' daily lives. Our focus on providing a broad range of key offerings contributes to the resilience of our business model. Our offerings are also deeply integrated into the lives of consumers, often on a daily basis, which drives loyalty and retention.

Our diversified app strategy provides us with the flexibility to adapt and deploy resources where consumer demand is highest. For example, the benefits of our model were best evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for mobility offerings declined as regions were subject to stay-athome and social distancing orders, but demand for deliveries rose significantly. In response, we enabled more than 237,000 driver-partners who were previously only serving the mobility segment to have the choice to serve both our mobility and deliveries segments in 2020 to respond to changes in demand.

## Synergies across offerings enable new innovative products

Integration across offerings on our platform also strengthens the superapp ecosystem, enabling the launch of new innovative products to our consumers, as well as our driver- and merchant-partners. For example, linking deliveries and financial services offerings on our platform, we have enabled deliveries-based coverage (together with our insurance partners in certain jurisdictions) such as Delivery Cover, which provides consumers protection against damage, theft or loss of an item when using the GrabExpress offering. Another example is GrabUnlimited, our paid loyalty subscription program. Users pay a flat fee to enjoy subscriber benefits and deals across our various services such as food, parcel deliveries and mobility.

Our superapp ecosystem has also enabled us to develop credit profiles for our driver- and merchant-partners, a typically underserved segment, which in turn provide them access to formal credit opportunities for the first time. With insights like understanding how much income is earned by our driverand merchant-partners through our platform, we are able to tailor responsible lending services. In 2024, the total loans disbursed across our financial services platform grew by 46% year-on-year to $2.2 billion.

We believe the breadth of offerings in our ecosystem and the synergies across these offerings will continue to enable us to quickly identify new growth areas and develop new innovative services to capture these opportunities.

## Our Approach

## Driving Southeast Asia forward with technology

Our technology allows us to manage dynamic, real-world interactions every day. It supports global payment capabilities, provides multilingual real-time community safety as well as user support, and caters to city-specific product requirements.

## Table of Contents

## Technology designed to be scalable, flexible and reliable

As our superapp serves users in over 800 cities across Southeast Asia, our technology systems are designed to be scalable, yet flexible enough to be hyperlocal. With millions of transactions taking place on our platform every day, our technology aims to reliably deliver a seamless and hyperlocal experience. Furthermore, our experiences take into account languages and other local variations specific to countries and cities across Southeast Asia. For example, the Grab app includes a secure chat with automatic translation between our driver-partners and our consumers (GrabChat).

## Technology that strives for security and integrity

Our superapp is powered by a unified technology and data platform, and improvements to our core technology architecture can be scaled quickly across our markets. For example, upon identifying fraud patterns on our booking flows in one market, we can roll out pre-allocation risk algorithms, a complex set of real-time logic that uses machine learning to predict the probability of fraudulent transactions before allocating the transaction across all our markets. In 2024, this predictive AI provided proactive protection for more than 4.5 billion transactions on our platform against malicious activities through a spectrum of adaptive risk interventions while ensuring optimal user experience.

## Global tech talent pool, local solutions

Our team of engineers, data scientists, data analysts, designers and product managers are located across eight research and development centers in Bangalore, Beijing, Cluj-Napoca, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Shenzhen and Singapore. Our highly specialized and talented technology team, spread across multiple geographical locations, builds solutions that combine Grab's strong engineering capabilities with local perspectives from our driver- and merchant partners and consumers who live in the same geographical location as our technology team. Our technology team not only designs, builds and optimizes our offerings for a broad spectrum of driver- and merchant-partners and consumers, but also keeps our technology platform running efficiently. They conduct hundreds of controlled experiments each month using our proprietary experimentation engine, 'ExP,' to drive regular improvements to both product experience and marketplace efficiency. This combination of technical know-how and local perspectives allows us to deliver personalized and hyper-localized solutions for our customers.

## Our technology priorities continue to be:

- · Reliability and resilience . We aim to provide a platform enabling a wide range of offerings to be provided to millions of people across Southeast Asia every day, and we take this responsibility seriously. If our systems fail to function correctly, we know that this directly impacts livelihoods. We strive to build technological capabilities and infrastructure that monitor our systems, detect software, hardware, or dependency problems quickly and offer a solution to mitigate disruptions. Due to such efforts, the reliability of our technology has generally improved, despite our business' growing scale and number of offerings.
- · Security . We aim to provide a secure platform for our wide range of offerings. We strive to incorporate security practices into our product development lifecycle, and to regularly review and update them according to what we believe to be industry best practices, as well as to regularly update our infrastructure for protection against the latest security vulnerabilities. GrabDefence is our proprietary anti-fraud detection and prevention system that learns from the millions of transactions we process daily to help us stay ahead of fraudulent activity.
- · Trust &amp; safety . We build technology solutions with the aim of creating and maintaining a safe and trusted experience on our platform, including facial recognition for the driver-partners and consumers using our platform where necessary (barring local regulatory or operating restrictions), trip monitoring to detect possible safety incidents, telematics to improve driving quality, digital know-your-customer checks for our driver- and merchant-partners as required by local regulations and ongoing fraud detection and prevention. Our constant investment in this area has enabled us to progressively improve and maintain low safety and fraud incident rates on our platform.

## Table of Contents

- · Marketplace optimization . Our technology systems make a vast number of decisions in real-time to try to optimize demand and supply across a multi-sided marketplace consisting of the driver- and merchant-partners and the consumers using our platform. With machine learning, we are able to make demand forecasts in real time for certain mobility and deliveries offerings, which help us to make better marketplace optimization decisions. Our marketplace design focuses on assisting our driver- and merchantpartners to maximize productivity while helping to ensure that the consumers are able to obtain on-demand rides from driverpartners and receive scheduled deliveries from our merchant-partners. In order to achieve this, our pricing, allocation and batching engines are designed to draw from a combination of artificial intelligence and machine learning to observe historical trends, match them with real-time environmental data and usage patterns and make intelligent decisions. For example, every order request factors in a large number of different attributes including the driver-partner profile, consumer ride history, location, time of day and more to help us make the best match possible. In addition, we forecast areas that we expect will see a spike in demand and make the data available to driver- and merchant-partners to improve the overall efficiency of our marketplace.
- · Artificial intelligence . The volume and frequency of data that we process through our platform each and every day provides valuable insights on consumption patterns and consumer behavior in Southeast Asia. We bring this data together with deep artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to deliver intelligent, personalized experiences and help solve problems in the region such as fraud. For example, our technology enables us to provide a predictive ride recommendation, so that a ride can be booked with one tap. We use computer vision to detect, identify and flag unclear images submitted by our merchant-partners. We also use machine learning, paired with GPS data from our driver-partners, to detect potentially unmapped roads.

We have invested in building key technology infrastructure in-house in order to better serve the needs of our partners, our employees and the consumers. We believe that these proprietary technologies not only provide us with a competitive advantage, but have also enabled us to become less dependent on external technology providers in certain cases. For example:

- · Our platform has served over 16 billion driver-partner trips and aggregated over 89 billion kilometers of GPS trace data. More importantly, many streets in the cities we operate in are actually alleys or shortcuts that are not mapped by mapping service providers. However, our two-wheel driver-partners are able to utilize these alleys and shortcuts in many situations. We integrate data from trips through these alleys and shortcuts into our maps, using the real-time mapping data we collect from our driverpartners. With our data and the investments we have made into AI and other technologies, we have developed proprietary mapping, routing, journey time prediction and point of interest ('POI') capabilities. This has not only helped reduce our reliance on external mapping service providers, but has also enabled us to improve user experience with more accurate travel time prediction and better routing.
- · We have developed a proprietary technology stack to power GrabAds, our in-house advertising platform. This stack includes advertisement serving, personalization and reporting capabilities that leverage Grab's unique assets, such as geo-location, loyalty rewards and GrabPay.

## Global and talented team with a heart to serve

Over the years, we have built a deep technical and business bench that thrives in a strong corporate culture. As a founder-led, mission-driven company that seeks to uplift our communities across the region, we place as much emphasis on cultural alignment with The Grab Way and our 4H principles as we do on technical or functional competency. This is reflected in our hiring and performance management practices and over time has enabled us to assemble a global and talented team that not only has a deep understanding of the local cultures and markets of Southeast Asia but also truly believes in our mission, the gravity of the societal problems we are solving and has a heart for, and the hunger to serve, our communities.

## Hyperlocal approach to solving problems of partners and consumers

As a pan-regional operator, with our superapp platform, we believe we are unique in Southeast Asia. We have demonstrated our ability to succeed and compete across multiple geographies because we recognize that every country we operate in is different.

## Being hyperlocal helps us adapt and grow in each market

Each country has different infrastructure, regulations, systems and consumer expectations. Recognizing this diversity is key to successful expansion in the region, and so we take a hyperlocal approach to our operations while still leveraging a unified technology platform and benefiting from the direction of regional product leadership.

This starts with having dedicated, local 'boots-on-the-ground' execution teams led by local leaders in each country that we operate. We also invest significant time in developing and maintaining deep and long-standing local relationships across the region, and a key aspect of our approach to doing business is our collaborative approach with various stakeholders and regulators in each of our markets.

## Being hyperlocal helps us meet our users' different needs

User experience is customized to suit the needs of our driver- and merchant-partners and consumers in each individual market. We recognize that problem solving at the local level is essential to succeed rather than a 'one-size fits all' approach, and we tailor our offerings accordingly. For example, we have developed solutions for locally popular modes of transportation, including GrabThoneBane in Mandalay, Myanmar, GrabTukTuk in Cambodia and Thailand, and GrabTrike and Move It in the Philippines. In Singapore, we combined taxis and private cars into a single fixed upfront fee supply pool under JustGrab because we realized that passengers were generally indifferent to the type of car that picked them up, so long as it was the fastest to arrive and there was upfront certainty over fares.

## Competition

We have a technology platform providing a broad range of everyday local offerings in a seamless superapp offered at a regional scale, localized for each country where we operate. The segments and markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences, fragmentation and frequent introductions of new offerings. We face competition in each of our segments and markets from single market and regional competitors and single segment and multiple segment players. We compete to attract, engage and retain consumers, driver-partners and merchant-partners and enable access to consumers based primarily on the following criteria:

- · Consumers . We compete to enable driver- and merchant-partners to attract, engage and retain consumers based on, among other things, convenience, reliability and value of offerings on our platform. We believe we are positioned favorably based on safety, value and breadth, depth and quality of offerings on our platform. The integration of offerings on our superapp platform provides consumers with one-stop access to everyday needs, differentiating us from many of our competitors.

## Table of Contents

- · Driver-Partners . We compete based on, among others, our ability to provide flexible income opportunities, attractive earning potential and the quality of our driver-partner community and work experience. We believe that we are positioned favorably, driven by the scale and breadth of our support for driver-partners, including technology-driven tools and services that enable them to increase their productivity and earnings. We also focus on supporting our driver-partners by providing them training and education initiatives that may be helpful with their career objectives.
- · Merchant-Partners . We compete based on, among others, our ability to generate consumer demand and the quality and value of our demand fulfillment and support services. We believe we are positioned favorably based on the scale of the consumer base on our platform and demand fulfillment capabilities as well as our broad array of merchant tools and services that enable merchantpartners to launch and scale their businesses.

For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled 'Item 3. Key Information-D. Risk Factors -Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry-We face intense competition across the segments and markets we serve.'

## Our Roadmap for Sustainable Growth

## Invest in Technology and Infrastructure

We plan to continue to invest in technology and infrastructure to enhance user experience and improve operational efficiency. For example, we plan to continue to:

- · Refine our on-demand delivery algorithm and mapping capabilities to further optimize routing and reduce delivery times.
- · Focus investment on AI to better predict our users' needs so as to enable more relevant, personalized and engaging experiences, while also improving workforce efficiency, as well as the efficiency of our driver- and merchant-partners.
- · Leverage automation to increase the efficiency of operational processes such as the processing of support enquiries.

## Drive Efficiencies and Monetization Opportunities across our Partner Network

The scale of our driver- and merchant-partner base and consumers using our platform creates significant opportunities for us to drive further growth and efficiency. For example, we plan to continue to:

- · Increase engagement as well as addressable advertising opportunities by increasing the breadth and deepening the personalization of our diversified offerings.
- · Optimize our driver-partner network and maximize efficiencies as we enable more driver-partners to service multiple verticals to satisfy demand.
- · Offer more tools to assist our merchant-partners to innovate and increase their revenue and productivity.
- · Cross-sell financial services such as loan and insurance products to our driver- and merchant-partners.

## Expand our Range of Products and Offerings with Focus on High Growth Areas

We are focused on expanding product offerings on our platform in the areas which we believe have the highest growth potential and which have the strongest synergies with the rest of our ecosystem. This includes:

- · Package and groceries delivery : These businesses are still relatively nascent and have much room for growth in tandem with the growth in e-commerce and the pandemic-induced shift to online grocery shopping. We plan to continue to explore and innovate new delivery models to offer the most affordable and convenient services to our consumers.

## Table of Contents

- · Financial services : We intend to continue leveraging our user base and scale in digital e-wallets and the wealth of transactional ecommerce data from within our ecosystem to innovate and offer new financial services products to consumers and small and medium-sized businesses. GXS Bank in Singapore and GXBank in Malaysia, along with our 30.84% equity interest in PT Super Bank Indonesia, will allow us to further empower more people to gain control of their finances and achieve better economic outcomes. Through the digital banking apps of GXS Bank and GXBank, respectively, we provide deposit and lending services in Singapore and deposit services in Malaysia.
- · Advertising services : We see significant potential in targeted advertising for merchant-partners so they may better realize opportunities from our extensive ecosystem and its unique features to increase their sales.
- · Subscription program : GrabUnlimited, our subscription program which is now available in Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, enables us to deepen user engagement and drive retention, transaction frequency and volume on our platform.

Furthermore, we see room for growth outside tier 1 cities that remain underpenetrated today. We will look to expand and localize our product offerings to address the needs of consumers in those cities.

## Pursue Targeted Investments, Acquisitions, and Strategic Partnerships

To complement our organic growth strategy, we expect to continue to selectively pursue investments and acquisitions that we believe will enhance user experience, as well as solidify and extend our market position. We have also successfully pursued a strategy of making strategic alliances with suitable partners such as Emtek in Indonesia, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. We intend to focus on investments, acquisitions and alliances that we believe will attract new consumers to our platform and broaden our offerings.

## Intellectual Property

Our brand value and technology, including our intellectual property, are some of our core assets. We protect our proprietary rights through a combination of intellectual property, contractual rights, and internal controls and procedures. These procedures include registered intellectual property, such as patents and patent applications, registered designs, registered trademarks, registered copyright, and unregistered intellectual property, including unregistered trademarks, unregistered copyrights, and trade secrets. We also protect our proprietary rights through license agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employees and contractors, employee and contractor disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other similar contractual rights, as well as administrative, physical, and technical controls to protect our confidential information and trade secrets.

As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,074 registered trademarks and 421 pending trademark applications across the various markets in which we operate, and we had registered 752 domain names.

As of December 31, 2024, we had 196 granted patents, 785 pending patent applications and 85 filed and/or registered designs throughout our markets of operation and research and development locations. Many of the patents and pending patent applications relate to our core technology such as customer matching, booking intelligence, location intelligence, map building and operations, platform optimization, safety and tracking services. Our software is also protected by copyright and trade secrets/confidential information laws. However, we cannot guarantee that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether such patent applications will issue with the same or similar claim scope as currently present. For example, we may narrow the claim scope of a patent application during the examination process. In addition, patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to detect third party infringement or our intellectual property or prevent third parties from infringing them.

We generally control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information with internal and external policies, processes and controls, including network security and contractual protections with employees, contractors and other third parties. To preserve our brand value, we also have brand enforcement programs in place and conduct regular reviews to monitor any infringement by third parties of our intellectual property rights.

## Table of Contents

Despite our various efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology. In addition, as we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we could face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights of third parties, including of our competitors, strategic partners, investors and other entities with whom we may share information or receive information from, and as a result may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others.

## Insurance

We maintain insurance coverage that we believe is relevant for our businesses and operations. Our insurance includes local property insurance in various countries, which also covers damages to our regional offices, business interruptions and public liabilities, errors and omissions, commercial motor insurance covering our vehicle fleets, employee insurance covering varying combinations of outpatient and inpatient medical in their home country and also whilst on business travel, term life, work injury and personal accidents, intellectual property infringement liability insurance, special risk insurance covering geopolitical crisis risks, and directors' and officers' liability insurance, among other coverage. In addition to this special risk insurance, we have also procured cybersecurity liability insurance covering primarily data and system recovery, cyber extortion, privacy and network security, media, professional indemnity liability and business interruption arising therefrom. We also have general commercial third-party liability insurance for GrabFood, personal accident insurance and prolonged medical leave insurance coverage for our driver-partners in Singapore, as well as rider's liability insurance in certain countries, including Singapore. We cannot guarantee, however, that we will not incur any losses or be the subject of any claims that exceed the scope of the relevant insurance coverage. We reassess our insurance structure at each renewal, taking into account both insurance market conditions and the expansion and development of our business.

## Regulatory Environment

Except as disclosed in this annual report, we believe we are in material compliance with the referenced regulations and there is not currently a known material risk of non-compliance.

## Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

In addition to the country-specific laws and regulations below, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ('PCI DSS') with respect to the acceptance of payment cards in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. PCI DSS sets forth security standards relating to the processing of cardholder data and the systems that process such data.

## Indonesia

## Regulations on Foreign Investment and Foreign Ownership Restrictions

Foreign investment in Indonesia, including our investments, is primarily governed under Law No. 25 of 2007 regarding Investment, issued on April 26, 2007 ('Law No. 25/2007'), as amended by Law No. 6 of 2023 on Stipulation of Government Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 2 of 2022 on Job Creation (the 'Omnibus Law,' and together with Law No. 25/2007, the 'Investment Law'). The Investment Law provides that all business sectors or business lines in Indonesia are open to foreign investment, except those which are expressly closed to or restricted from foreign investment, or those business sectors or business lines that can only be carried out by the central government, co-operatives or micro, small and medium enterprises. The Investment Law also stipulates that foreign direct investment in Indonesia must be in the form of a limited liability company, established by virtue of the laws of and domiciled in the Republic of Indonesia.

The Indonesian government from time to time provides a list of business activities that are either open to foreign investment, subject to certain conditions or closed to foreign investment, which is known as the 'Investment List.' The current Investment List is set forth in Presidential Regulation ('PR') No. 10 of 2021 regarding Investment Business Activities, dated February 2, 2021, as amended by PR No. 49 of 2021 dated May 24, 2021 ('Amended PR 10/2021'). Foreign investors wishing to invest in Indonesia must structure their investment in accordance with the restrictions or requirements applicable to their intended business activities under the Amended PR 10/2021. They must also determine whether the foreign investment company can be wholly or partially owned by foreign shareholders before setting up the company.

## Special Rental Transportation

Minister of Transportation's ('MOT') Regulation No. PM 118 of 2018 regarding Special Rental Transportation, dated December 18, 2018 as last amended by MoT Regulation No. PM 17 of 2019, and partially revoked by MOT Regulation No. PM 25 of 2021 regarding Provision of Street Transportation Sector, dated June 4, 2021 ('Amended MOT Reg. 118/2018'), defines special rental transportation as door-to-door transportation service with a driver, having an operational area within an urban area, from and to airports, seaports, or other transportation points, in which the booking is made through a technologybased application, with the tariffs disclosed in the application. To engage in the special rental transportation business, which includes both mobility and deliveries services, a company must obtain a special rental transportation organization license. Accordingly, PT Teknologi Pengangkutan Indonesia's fourwheel rental business is subject to the Amended MOT Reg. 118/2018.

The Amended MOT Reg. 118/2018 provides that the minimum and maximum tariffs per kilometer are to be determined by the MOT or governor, depending on the operational area.

Directorate General of Land Transportation Regulation No. SK.3244/AJ.801/DJPD/2017 regarding Upper Limit Tariff and Lower Limit Tariff for Special Rental Transportation, dated June 30, 2017 ('DGLT Reg. 3244/2017'), sets forth the minimum and maximum tariffs as follows:

| Region                                             | Minimum Tariff   | Minimum Tariff   | Maximum Tariff   | Maximum Tariff   |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Sumatra, Java, Bali                                | IDR              | 3,500 /km        | IDR              | 6,000 /km        |
| Kalimantan, Nusa Tenggara, Sulawesi, Maluku, Papua | IDR              | 3,700 /km        | IDR              | 6,500 /km        |

The tariffs set forth above may be evaluated periodically, at least every six months.

DGLT Reg. 3244/2017 requires special rental transportation providers to determine the applicable tariffs for their services. They may be required to report the same to the governor or the head of the Transportation Management Agency of each region where the provider is domiciled or conducts its business activities. Failure to comply with the above tariff requirements could subject the offender to administrative sanctions including, but not limited to, written warnings and administrative fines. The written warnings will likely subject the offending special rental transportation service company to reputational risks since, although the warnings will be directly given to the company, there is no guarantee that the regulator will not disclose the existence of sanctions to stakeholders or the public. Failure to comply with order in written warnings within 60 days will also subject the company to administrative fines in the range of IDR 1,000,000 to IDR 5,000,000 (approximately $62 to $309).

Special rental transportation services must comply with the minimum service standards set out in the Amended MOT Reg. 118/2018. These minimum standards cover security, safety, accessibility, equality, and orderliness. With regard to minimum safety standards, the Amended MOT Reg. 118/2018 requires that vehicles used to deliver special rental transportation services be no more than five years old. This is to ensure the safety and comfort of passengers. Failure to comply with this requirement could subject the offending special rental transportation services company to administrative sanctions in the form of written warnings, temporary suspension of license (between three to twelve months), and restriction of business expansion (between six to twelve months). The written warnings will likely subject the offending special rental transportation service company to reputational risks since, although the warnings will be directly given to the company, there is no guarantee that the regulator will not disclose the existence of sanctions to stakeholders or the public. In addition, if a company fails to comply with an order to restrict its business expansion, the regulator is empowered to revoke its business license.

A special rental transportation services company must be in the form of a legal entity (i.e., state-owned enterprise, regional-owned enterprise, limited liability company or cooperative). Special rental transportation business activities can also be carried out by micro and small enterprises, subject to applicable laws and regulations including Law No. 20/2008, as amended by Omnibus Law. On the other hand, a technology-based application company is required to enter into cooperation with such special rental transportation companies, to enable those special rental transportation companies in providing the relevant door-to-door special transportation service to passengers via online application.

## Regulations on Platform-Based Motorcycles Transportation Services

MOT Regulation No. 12 of 2019 regarding Safety Precautions for Users of Motorcycles Used for Public Purposes ('MOT Reg. 12/2019') stipulates the obligations of drivers and passengers in relation to motorcycles used for public transportation purposes, either with or without the use of an electronic software application. When an electronic software application is used in connection with the use of motorcycles for public transportation purposes, the company providing the electronic application ('Platform Company') must ensure safety and order of operation, maintain general standard operating procedures, and follow the MOT's guidelines on service fees and the imposed tariff. This regulation applies to PT Grab Teknologi Indonesia as the entity holding the license to operate the Grab platform.

With regard to physical safety, the Platform Company shall ensure that (i) the identities of drivers are properly displayed on the platform; (ii) drivers possess valid driving licenses and motor vehicle registrations; (iii) the customer service number is shown on the platform; and (iv) the platform is equipped with a panic button for both drivers and the passengers. The Platform Company shall also provide shelters for drivers to pick up and drop off passengers and shall provide guidance and supervision of drivers with regard to traffic compliance and safety.

With regard to general standards and operational procedures, the Platform Company is required to have standard operating procedures in place for drivers handling orders. The standard operating procedures shall include: (i) types of activities/violations which may subject driver-partners to sanctions in the form of temporary suspension of operations or termination; (ii) the stages for the gradual imposition of sanctions in the form of suspension or termination of driver-partners; (iii) provisions on the various steps that must be followed with respect to the temporary suspension or termination of driver-partners; and (iv) the steps for revoking temporary suspension of driver-partners. The standard operating procedures must be in place prior to engaging drivers as partners and the Platform Company must take steps to ensure drivers are familiar with the standard operating procedure.

In 2019, the MOT also issued MOT Decree 348/2019, which requires Platform Companies to impose a service fee based on the formula and service fee calculation guidance provided by the MOT, and drivers to charge passengers the tariff as set out in the platform. The MOT Degree 348/2019 provides that the maximum commission that Platform Companies may take from the total tariffs is 20%, and requires Platform Companies to take steps to ensure drivers and passengers are aware of the tariffs. The decree also prescribes the floor, ceiling and minimum tariffs, taking into account the zones where motorcycle drivers operate, motorcycle insurance, fuel and maintenance cost. On September 7, 2022, the MOT issued MOT Decree 667/2022, which came into effect on September 10, 2022 and revoked MOT Decree 348/2019. Among other things, MOT Decree 667/2022 reduced the maximum commission that Platform Companies may take from the total tariffs from 20% to 15%. MOT Decree 667/2022 was later amended by MOT Decree 1001/2022, which came into effect on November 22, 2022 and allows Platform Companies to charge driver-partners a supporting fee that is equal to at most 5% of the total tariff, in addition to the commission, which is at most 15% of the total tariff. According to MOT Decree 1001/2022, the supporting fee should be reinvested into the welfare of the driver-partners with specific components, including (i) extra safety insurance in addition to the required national health, (ii) social and employment security program, (iii) information center support for driver-partners' complaints, and (iv) operational cost assistance for phone credits, gears and so on. If a Platform Company decides to charge supporting fees to its driver-partners, the Platform Company is required to submit periodic reports about the use of supporting fees so collected to the Director-General of Land Transport for evaluation. A Platform Company that does not use the supporting fees for permitted purposes may be subject to sanctions. We have complied with the requirements under MOT Decree 667/2022 (as amended by MOT Decree 1001/2022), including the periodic report requirements.

## Payment Systems

Payment systems are regulated under Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 22/23/PBI/2020 of 2020 regarding Payment Systems, dated December 30, 2020 ('BI Reg. 22/2020'). Bank Indonesia issued Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 23/6/PBI/2021 on Payment Services Provider ('BI Reg 23/2021'), which came into effect on July 1, 2021 that outlines implementing rules and provisions in furtherance of BI Reg. 22/2020. BI Reg. 22/2020 defines a payment system as a system that encompasses a set of regulations, institutions, mechanisms, infrastructure, source of funds for payment, and access to the source of funds for payment, which are used to carry out fund transfers to fulfill obligations arising from an economic activity. Under BI Reg. 22/2020, there are two types of payment system service providers: (i) a payment service provider (Penyedia Jasa Pembayaran ('PJP')) (such as OVO), which is a bank or non-bank entity that provides services to facilitate payment transactions for users; and (ii) a payment system infrastructure operator (Penyelenggara Infrastruktur Sistem Pembayaran ('PIP')), which is a party that provides infrastructure that can be used to conduct fund transfers for the benefit of its members. Bank Indonesia has the authority to issue licenses for PJP and stipulations/appointments for PIPs. PJP licenses and PIP stipulations/appointments are non-transferrable.

## Table of Contents

BI Reg. 22/2020 and BI Reg. 23/2021 impose a maximum foreign share ownership of 85% (up to the ultimate shareholder level) in a non-bank PJP and certain domestic control requirements. These domestic control requirements include: (i) minimum 51% of shares with voting rights being held by a domestic party; (ii) the power to nominate the majority of the board of directors and/or board of commissioners, if any, being held by a domestic party; and (iii) the power to veto a decision or approval made in a general meeting of shareholders that significantly impacts the company, if any, being held by a domestic party. In case of non-compliance with the foregoing restrictions, Bank Indonesia may impose administrative sanctions such as warnings, temporary suspension or suspension of a part of or the entire business activity (including any cooperation) and revocation of the payment service provider license.

## Information Technology-based Joint Funding Services ('P2P Lending')

P2P Lending, a business carried out by one of our Indonesian subsidiaries, is regulated under OJK Regulation No. 40 of 2024 regarding Information Technology-based Joint Funding Services, dated December 24, 2024 ("OJK Reg. 40/2024"), which superseded the OJK Regulation No. 10/POJK.05/2022 TAHUN 2022 ('OJK Reg. 10/2022'). Foreign ownership in a P2P Lending company is limited and will be further stipulated under government regulations, which had not been issued as of the date of this annual report. Therefore, the OJK Reg 40/2024 does not amend the foreign ownership restriction threshold, ie, 85% directly or indirectly foreign ownership, subject to certain exceptions, which was previously governed under OJK Reg. 10/2022. Article 58 of OJK Reg. 40/2024 also requires that any change to the controlling shareholder of a P2P Lending company and the controlling shareholder of the P2P Lending company's controlling shareholder shall obtain OJK's prior approval.

Other than the change of controlling shareholder mentioned above, P2P Lending company (but not its shareholders) shall notify the OJK of its corporate actions no later than 20 working days upon such changes. OJK Reg. 40/2024 also stipulates a three-year lock-up period from the date of issuance of a P2P Lending company's business license, during which the P2P Lending company is prohibited from changing its controlling shareholder, except for restructuring purposes as mandated by the OJK.

Under OJK Reg. 40/2024, a P2P Lending company may apply to the OJK for a license. The OJK requires a P2P Lending company to obtain an Electronic System Provider Certificate (Tanda Daftar Penyelenggara Sistem Elektronik or 'TDPSE') from the Minister of Communication and Digital Affairs, in addition to the license issued by the OJK, and restricts providers from conducting any funding activity before obtaining a TDPSE. Failure to obtain a TDPSE or conducting funding activity before obtaining a TDPSE may result in the revocation of the existing license. A P2P Lending company must ensure its issued capital is fully paid in cash and placed in a term deposit opened in the name of the P2P Lending company in a conventional Indonesian commercial bank. Further, a P2P Lending company must ensure that any investment made by its shareholders does not originate from (and done for the purposes of) any financial crime (e.g., money laundering or terrorism funding) and is not sourced through loans.

Under Article 7 of OJK Reg. 40/2024, a P2P Lending company must have an issued capital with a minimum of IDR 25 billion (approximately around $1,500,000) since its establishment.

Article 130(1) of OJK Reg. 40/2024 defines the business activity conducted by a P2P Lending company as comprising three activities, i.e., the provision, management, and operation of information technology-based joint funding services, conducted on the basis of either conventional or sharia financing principles. Article 136(1) of OJK Reg. 40/2024 states that the provision of such services is further classified into two types of funding, i.e., (i) productive funding, and (ii) consumptive funding. The maximum funding limit is at IDR 2 billion (approximately $124,000), but may be maxed at IDR5 billion (approximately $309,000) for productive lending if the bad funding quality rate does not fall below 5% for 6 consecutive months and not in a business limitation or suspension as imposed by OJK. Article 137(5) and (6) of OJK Reg. 40/2024 further provide that the funding that can be provided by a single lender and/or its affiliates is capped at no more than 25% of the total funding provided through a particular P2P Lending company as of the end of each month starting. This funding limit and the restrictions on lenders and their affiliates do not apply to OJK-licensed/supervised financial institutions, which are subject to a fixed lending limit of 75% of the total funding position at the end of each month. Failure to comply with any provision under OJK Reg. 40/2024 could subject the offending party to administrative sanctions in the form of written warnings partial or total suspension of business activities; limitations on business activities; decrease in risk assessment ratings; revocation of approval; prohibition from becoming a PSP, director, commissioner, and/or sharia supervisory board; and/or administrative fines.

OJK Regulation No. 4/POJK.05/2021 of 2021 dated March 9, 2021 (which has been partially amended by OJK Reg. 10/2022), regarding the Implementation of Risk Management in the Use of Information Technology by Non-Bank Financial Service Institutions ('OJK Reg. 4/2021'), requires a P2P Lending company to place its data center and disaster recovery center in Indonesia. P2P Lending companies must comply with the minimum standards for technology, technology risk management, technology security, system disturbance and failure resistance, and technology management transfer.

Law No. 4 of 2023 on the Development and Strengthening of the Financial Sector ('Law No. 4/2023') became effective on January 12, 2023. While this law concerns several categories of banking and financing services, currently it has no provisions that materially affect banks and P2P Lending companies. However, we will need to anticipate any implementing regulations of Law No. 4/2023 that may further impact banks and P2P Lending companies.

OJK issued Circular Letter No. 19/SEOJK.06/2023 on the Conduct of Information Technology-based Joint Funding Services ('OJK CL 19/2023'), as an implementing regulation to OJK Reg. 10/2022. OJK CL 19/2023 outlines a number of provisions relating to caps on 'economic benefits' that can be imposed by a P2P Lending company on its users. 'Economic benefits' include interest/margin/profit sharing, administration fees/commissions/platform fees/ujrah, other fees (excluding late fees or fines for overdue payments), stamp duties, and taxes. The applicable maximum percentage rates (as detailed below) are applied against the total amount of funding stipulated in the funding/loan agreement. Late fees or fines for overdue payments (which are outside the scope of 'economic benefits') are now also subject to caps. The details on the timelines for implementing these caps and the rates for the caps according to the types of funding are as follows:

## Funding for Productive Purposes

| Implementation Period             | Maximum Economic Benefits   |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| January 1, 2024 - January 1, 2025 | 0.1% per calendar day       |
| From January 1, 2026 onwards      | 0.067% per calendar day     |
| Implementation Period             | Maximum Late Fees           |
| January 1, 2024 - January 1, 2025 | 0.1% per calendar day       |
| From January 1, 2026 onwards      | 0.067% per calendar day     |

## Funding for Consumptive Purposes (Multipurposes)

| Implementation Period        | Maximum Economic Benefits   |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Year 2024                    | 0.3% per calendar day       |
| Year 2025                    | 0.2% per calendar day       |
| From January 1, 2026 onwards | 0.1% per calendar day       |

## E-Commerce Trade Business License

Government Regulation No. 80 of 2019 dated November 25, 2019 regarding Electronic Commerce ('GR 80/2019') and Minister of Trade Regulation No. 31 of 2023 dated September 25, 2023 regarding Business Licensing, Advertising, Development, and Supervision of Business Actors In Trading Through Electronic Systems ('MOT Reg. 31/2023' and together with GR 80/2019-'E-Commerce Regulations') require business actors that provide Electronic Communication facilities for trading transactions ('E-Commerce Providers') to obtain an E-Commerce Trade Business License (Surat Izin Usaha Perdagangan Melalui Sistem Elektronik, or 'SIUPMSE'). GR 80/2019 defines Electronic Communication as any communication used in an e-commerce transaction (i.e., trading transactions carried out through the electronic system) in the form of a statement, declaration, request, notification or application, confirmation, offer, or acceptance of an offer, containing the parties' agreement to create or perform a specific agreement. Under the official elucidation of Article 5 of GR 80/2019, Electronic Communication facilities may function as a medium for the delivery of information, communication, settlement of transaction, payment system, and/or goods delivery system which shall include marketplace or the platform provider. Any E-Commerce Provider who operates without a SIUPMSE will be subject to administrative sanctions in the form of written warnings, blacklisting and temporary blocking of E-Commerce Providers services by the relevant authorized institutions. We have obtained the E-Commerce Trade Business Licenses for our relevant Indonesian entities, including for PT Grab Teknologi Indonesia for GrabMart's website address. Specifically for Indonesia marketplace business in the Grab app under PT Grab Teknologi Indonesia, Grab has developed an application interface to display the contact information of the Directorate-General of Consumer Protection and Trade Order on a page that is easy for consumers to read as required by MOT Reg. 31/2023 to effectuate the SIUPMSE that PT Grab Teknologi Indonesia has obtained for the new system of Grab app.

## Regulations on Personal Data Protection

Law No. 27 of 2022 on Personal Data Protection (the 'PDP Law') regulates the definition of personal data controller, personal data processor and their responsibilities in using personal data. It distinguishes between general personal data (e.g., full name, gender, nationality, marriage status, religion, or other personal data that can identify a person) and specific personal data (e.g. health data, biometric data, genetic data, criminal records, financial data, and child data). It provides comprehensive provisions for the protection of personal data to be fulfilled by the data controller or processor who possesses and/or utilizes personal data for its data processing activities.

Under the PDP Law, in the event of a data breach, personal data controllers must notify data subjects and the data protection agency (which has not yet been determined by the President of Indonesia) in writing within 72 hours. In certain conditions, for example, if the data breach disrupts public services, or it has a material and adverse effect to public interest, personal data controllers must make a public notification of the data breach.

For any violation of the PDP Law, an administrative sanction and/or criminal sanction may be imposed. Administrative sanctions can be in the form of warning letters, suspension of data processing activities, deletion of personal data, and/or administrative fines. The maximum administrative fine is 2% of the annual income or annual revenue depending on the degree of violation.

The criminal sanction imposed will depend on the type of violation, and penalties include imprisonment terms ranging from four to six years and/or monetary penalty ranging from IDR 4 billion to IDR 6 billion (approximately $247,000 to $371,000). For corporate criminal sanction, imprisonment terms may apply to the involved personnel who acted as the organization's management or decision-makers and/or persons who benefited from the violation. In addition, organizations can be imposed with fines of up to ten times of the criminal fines that an individual might be subject to.

## Table of Contents

The organization may also be subject to additional sanctions such as confiscation of profits and/or assets that are obtained as a result of the crime, suspension of business activities, permanent ban or closure of business activities, rectification of breached obligations, compensation payment to subject data, revocation of licenses, and/or liquidation of the organization.

## Regulations on Postal Services

Postal services such as our point-to-point delivery services offering done though PT Solusi Pengiriman Indonesia are generally regulated under Law No. 38 of 2009 regarding Post, dated October 14, 2009, as amended by the Omnibus Law ('Amended Law No. 38/2009'). Postal service is defined under the Amended Law No. 38/2009 as a written communication and/or electronic letter, package, logistics, financial transaction, and postal agency service for public purposes. Postal services are carried out by a provider that can be in the form of a state-owned enterprise, regional-owned enterprise, private enterprise or cooperative.

Universal and commercial postal business activities are subject to foreign ownership restrictions. Under the Amended Law No. 38/2009, and Investment Law (as implemented further under (i) the Amended PR 10/2021 and (ii) Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (Badan Koordinasi Penanaman Modal or 'BKPM') Regulation Number 5 of 2021), foreign ownership in a company that engages in domestic postal business activity is limited to a maximum of 49%. In case of non-compliance with the foregoing restriction, BKPM or the relevant authority (e.g., provincial investment agency or municipal investment agency) can impose tiered administrative sanctions, i.e., first-and-final written warning or temporary suspension of business activities. If no remedy or followup action is undertaken by the non-compliant entity upon receiving such warning or suspension, BKPM or relevant authority is empowered to revoke the applicable license.

## Regulations on Competition

Business competition and monopolistic practices in Indonesia are generally regulated under Law No. 5 of 1999 regarding Prohibition of Monopolistic Practices and Unfair Competition, dated March 5, 1999, as amended by the Omnibus Law (the "Amended Competition Law'). Pursuant to the Amended Competition Law, business actors in Indonesia are prohibited from, among other things, (i) entering into anti-competitive agreements or engaging in conduct that results in oligopoly and/or oligopsony, price-fixing and resale price maintenance, market allocations, boycotts, vertical integration or closed agreements; (ii) engaging in actions such as monopoly, monopsony or market control; and (iii) abusing dominant positions. There are two types of standard of proof recognized under the Amended Competition Law, depending on the provision thereof, namely the 'rule of reason' and 'illegal per se.' The 'rule of reason' requires the assessment of the anti-competitive effects of the business activity, while 'illegal per se' provides that a violation exists insofar as all elements provided under the Amended Competition Law are met.

The Business Competition Supervisory Commission (Komisi Pengawas Persaingan Usaha ('KPPU')) has the authority to supervise the implementation of the Amended Competition Law. The KPPU is an independent institution that reports to the President of the Republic of Indonesia. Further, transactions that meet certain thresholds set forth in the Competition Law and KPPU regulations must be reported post factum to the KPPU within 30 business days of the date on which the transaction is legally effective. The KPPU has the authority to substantively review whether the transaction is in violation of the Amended Competition Law, and the transaction may then be subjected to certain structural and/or behavioral remedies.

Pursuant to the Amended Competition Law, and as further elaborated by Government Regulation No. 44 of 2021 regarding Implementation of Prohibition of Monopolistic Practices and Unfair Competition ('GR No. 44/2021'), dated February 2, 2021, non-compliance with the Amended Competition Law could subject the offending party to administrative sanctions imposed by the KPPU. These administrative sanctions include annulment of the relevant agreement, order of cessation of the prohibited action, unwinding of the relevant transaction, payment of compensation, and administrative fine. The administrative fine is subject to the minimum of IDR 1 billion (approximately $100,000) and the maximum of (i) 50% of the net profit received by the perpetrator in the relevant market during the period in which the non-compliance persists, (ii) 10% of the total sales in the relevant market during the period in which the non-compliance persists or (iii) IDR 25 billion (approximately $1.5 million), which applies only for failure to report a notifiable transaction to the KPPU in a timely manner. Under Article 15 of GR No. 44/2021, several factors can mitigate the administrative sanctions imposed by the KPPU if a violation is found, including having a proper competition compliance program. KPPU has introduced a competition compliance program certification to enable companies to benefit from the mitigation factor provided under GR No. 44/2021. PT Grab Teknologi Indonesia has obtained the competition compliance program certification from the KPPU that is valid for five years until December 2028.

## Table of Contents

In addition to having the authority to enforce the Competition Law, KPPU also has the authority to enforce Law No. 20/2008. Under Law No. 20/2008, KPPU focuses on supervising the fairness and balance of partnerships between medium and large enterprises and micro and small enterprises. Medium and large enterprises are prohibited from imposing control over the micro and small enterprises or abusing their bargaining position to unfairly profit from the partnership to the detriment of the micro and small enterprises. KPPU may order the large or medium enterprises to amend the partnership agreements or arrangements and provide up to three warning periods for such amendments to be carried out. KPPU may impose sanctions ranging from IDR10 billion (approximately $618,000) for large enterprises or IDR5 billion (approximately $309,000) for medium enterprises if violation is found as well as a recommendation for revocation of business license if the situation is not remedied during the warning periods.

## Regulations on the Distribution of Insurance Products

Marketing channels for insurance products are generally regulated under OJK Regulation No. 8 of 2024 regarding Insurance Products and Marketing of Insurance Products, dated April 25, 2024 ('OJK Reg. 8/2024'). OJK Reg. 8/2024 is an implementing regulation for Law No. 40 of 2014 regarding Insurance, dated October 17, 2014. OJK Reg. 8/2024 regulates that insurance companies can market their insurance products only through: (i) direct marketing; (ii) duly registered and certified insurance agents (self-employed or employees of a business entity, acting on behalf of the insurance company and qualified to represent such insurance company in marketing insurance products) and companies that employ insurance agents; (iii) bancassurance (cooperation between an insurance company and a bank for the purpose of marketing insurance products through the bank); (iv) a non-bank business entity; and/or (v) a special marketing agent for micro insurance products.

The marketing of insurance products through the available marketing channels must be documented in a cooperation agreement. Insurance companies must also obtain prior OJK approval before marketing insurance products through certain marketing channels. Under OJK Circular Letter No. 19/SEOJK.05/2020 regarding Marketing Channels for Insurance Products, dated October 2, 2020 ('CL No. 19'), as amended by OJK Circular Letter No. 30/SEOJK.05/2022 dated December 27, 2022, prior OJK approval is required for the following marketing channels: (i) bancassurance, (ii) sales force of branchless banking agents (agen bank penyelenggara laku pandai) and (iii) a cooperation with a non-bank business entity that utilizes the business entity's electronic system. Failure to obtain OJK approval prior to the marketing of insurance products could lead to the imposition of administrative sanctions on the insurance company (though not the marketing channel entity), including written warnings, fines and revocation of its business license.

The marketing of insurance products can be conducted by using an electronic system, be it a website and/or online application system. CL No. 19 requires any insurance company, as well as insurance agent, bank, and non-bank entity acting as an insurance marketing channel, using an electronic system to market its insurance products to (i) have an electronic system provider certificate (Tanda Daftar Penyelenggara Elektronik ('TDPSE')), a license issued by the Minister of Communications and Informatics; (ii) own and have implemented a technology risk management policy, standards, and procedures; and (iii) satisfy all requirements set out by the OJK and other authorized government agencies in connection with electronic system administration. OJK may instruct insurance companies to stop all distribution activities and/or cooperation with other parties with respect to the marketing of insurance products in the event that the relevant marketing activities are not in line with the rules set by the OJK.

## Singapore

## Regulations on Ride-hailing

The Point-to-Point Passenger Transport Industry Act 2019 (the 'PPPTIA') is the principal piece of legislation that covers the ride-hailing booking services provided by us in Singapore including GrabCar, GrabTaxi and GrabHitch. Licensees are required to, among other things, comply with the conditions set out in their licenses, and to comply with any directions, codes of practice and/or emergency directives issued by the Land Transport Authority. We have obtained the relevant licenses under the PPPTIA to provide our ride-hailing booking services in Singapore.

In addition, ride-hail licensees under the PPPTIA are required to ensure that the ride-hail fares associated with their services are consistent with the pricing policies put in place by the Public Transport Council.

Under the conditions of the licenses granted to us under the PPPTIA, we are also required to ensure that our driver-partners are compliant with certain legislative requirements relating to motor vehicle insurance and public service vehicle licensing.

## Table of Contents

The penalties for non-compliance with the conditions of the licenses granted under the PPPTIA include revocation or suspension of the licenses and/or the imposition of financial penalties up to the amount of 10% of the licensee's annual turnover or SGD 100,000 (approximately $74,000) per instance of non-compliance.

The penalties for non-compliance with the pricing policies put in place by the Public Transport Council include the imposition of fines of up to the amount of SGD 100,000 (approximately $74,000) and/or imprisonment for a term of up to six months.

## Regulations on GrabFood / GrabMart / GrabExpress

There are no laws in Singapore which specifically govern the provision of package delivery services in Singapore. That said, certain rules under the Road Traffic Act 1961 (the 'RTA') and its subsidiary legislation prohibit chauffeured private hire car drivers and taxi drivers from providing any courier pick-up and delivery service using their chauffeured private hire car or taxi, without the prior approval of the Registrar of Vehicles appointed under the RTA. Such requirements may apply to the driver-partners who are licensed as chauffeured private hire car drivers and taxi drivers and who provide package delivery services under GrabExpress, and/or delivery services under GrabFood/GrabMart. Only a very small number of driver-partners (who are licensed as chauffeured private hire car drivers and taxi drivers) provide courier pick-up and delivery services.

## Regulations on Competition Laws

The Competition Act 2004 (the 'Competition Act') prohibits anti-competitive practices. Specific prohibited activities include agreements that prevent, restrict or distort competition, abuse of dominance and mergers that substantially lessen competition, whether these take place within or outside of Singapore, so long as they have an impact on a market in Singapore. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (the 'CCCS') is responsible for administering and enforcing the Competition Act, which covers all industries and sectors unless specifically exempted or excluded. Infringements of the Competition Act can result in financial penalties of up to 10% of the turnover of the business in Singapore for each year of infringement, up to a maximum of three years. The CCCS also has powers to impose directions requiring infringing undertakings to stop or modify the activity or conduct, or in the case of anticompetitive mergers, to remedy, mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects arising from the merger. For mergers, the CCCS may also consider interim measures to prevent merger parties from taking any action that might prejudice the CCCS's ability to consider the merger situation further and/or to impose appropriate remedies. Such interim measures may include directions that stop the implementation of the merger, or where the merger has already been implemented, require a merger to be dissolved or modified.

## Regulations on Safety and Health of Our Employees and Contractors

The Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006 (the 'WSHA') is the principal legislation governing the safety, health and welfare of persons at work in workplaces. Among other things, the WSHA imposes a duty on every employer, platform operator and every principal (which would include us) to take, so far as is reasonably practicable, such measures as are necessary to ensure the safety and health of its employees, its platform workers, and any contractor, any direct or indirect subcontractor, and any employee employed by such contractor or subcontractor, when at work.

The general penalties for non-compliance with the WSHA include the imposition of fines of up to SGD 500,000 (approximately $368,000) in the case of a body corporate. Further or other penalties may apply in the case of repeat offenses or specific offenses under the WSHA or its subsidiary legislation.

## Regulations on Platform Workers

The Platform Workers Act 2024 ('PWA') provides for the rights and obligations of platform operators and platform workers in Singapore (being ourselves and our driver-partners, respectively).

Among other things, the PWA:

- · requires platform operators and platform workers to make prescribed contributions to the platform worker's statutory social security savings account, if applicable. The penalties for non-compliance with the provisions on prescribed contributions include the imposition of fines up to SGD10,000 (approximately $7,000) and/or imprisonment for a term of up to seven years.

## Table of Contents

- · provides for the establishment of a representation framework for platform workers via 'platform worker associations' which may potentially represent platform workers in negotiating with the platform operator on terms of work and benefits and the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes.
- · sets out certain obligations on our part in respect of platform workers (such as record keeping and obligations to provide earnings slips).
- · provides that platform operators must provide work injury compensation and work injury compensation insurance in respect of each platform worker.

## Regulations on Financial Services

## Payment Services

MAS regulates the provision of payment services in Singapore under the Payment Services Act 2019, which came into force on January 28, 2020 (the 'PS Act') and was amended by the Payment Services (Amendment) Act 2021. Unless excluded or exempt, an entity must obtain the relevant license to provide regulated payment services under the PS Act, which include account issuance service, e-money issuance service, domestic money transfer service, cross-border money transfer service, merchant acquisition service, digital payment token service, and money-changing service.

Under the PS Act, licensees may generally be subject to obligations relating to general approval requirements for changes of control, appointment and removal of CEOs and directors, general notification and record-keeping requirements, audit requirements, base capital requirements, anti-money laundering requirements (see below), the requirement to furnish security (for a major payment institution), the requirement to safeguard customer monies (for a major payment institution), and other applicable requirements. Licensees are expected to implement certain systems, processes and controls in line with MAS' Guidelines on Risk Management Practices applicable to financial institutions in Singapore. Non-compliance with the above could, depending on the specific requirement or offense, potentially result in sanctions by the MAS or other actions being taken, including the revocation or suspension of a license, fines or warnings, and criminal penalties for the relevant licensees and/or its officers.

## Insurance Agents

MAS regulates the insurance business in Singapore, insurers, insurance intermediaries and related institutions under the Insurance Act 1966 (the 'IA'). A person that arranges contracts of insurance on behalf of insurers is likely to be construed as an insurance agent, and if so construed, must register with the General Insurance Association of Singapore (GIA)'s Agents' Registration Board through the principal insurers that they wish to represent, unless exempt. Among other things, an insurance agent must operate under a written agreement, comply with certain pre-contract disclosures, act only for insurers entitled to carry on business in Singapore, and abide by other conduct of business requirements under Part 2B of the IA, and other relevant regulations and industry best practices. There are also minimum competency requirements that apply to insurance agents imposed on direct general insurers by way of Notices issued by the MAS (such as MAS Notice 211 Minimum and Best Practice Training and Competency Standards for Direct General Insurers). Non-compliance with the above could, depending on the specific requirement or offense, potentially result in sanctions by the MAS or other actions being taken, including fines or warnings, and criminal penalties for the relevant insurance agent and/or its officers.

## Digital Banking

On June 28, 2019, MAS announced that it would issue up to two digital full bank ('DFB') licenses and three digital wholesale bank ('DWB') licenses, pursuant to applications submitted by December 31, 2019. A DFB will be allowed to take deposits from and provide banking services to retail and non-retail customer segments, while a DWB will be allowed to take deposits from and provide banking services to SMEs and other non-retail customer segments. These new digital banks are in addition to any digital banks that Singapore licensed banks may have already established under the MAS' existing internet banking framework.

## Table of Contents

All successful applicants must first receive an In-Principle-Approval ('IPA') letter from the MAS and will then have up to twelve months to comply with the conditions under the IPA, before being awarded the license and can commence business. DFBs will commence operations as a restricted DFB before becoming a full functioning DFB. Such DFBs, like other banks in Singapore, will be subject to the Banking Act 1970 (the 'Banking Act'), and all applicable regulations, notices, guidelines and other regulatory instruments issued thereunder. In particular, certain key provisions applicable to a DFB by virtue of the application of the Banking Act relate to change of control approval requirements, minimum capital requirements, risk-based capital and liquidity requirements (see MAS Notice 637 Risk Based Capital Adequacy Requirements for Banks Incorporated in Singapore and MAS Notice 649 Minimum Liquid Assets and Liquidity Coverage Ratio), audited accounts, minimum asset requirements, prohibited businesses, transfer of business, banking privacy and the MAS' powers. DFBs will also be required to be a member of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.

The minimum paid-up capital requirements, deposit cap requirements, risk-based capital and liquidity rules, and scope of permissible activities are expected to progressively increase as the licensee progresses from a restricted DFB to a full functioning DFB. The MAS generally expects a DFB to be fully functioning within three to five years from commencement of business.

Non-compliance with the above could, depending on the specific requirement or offense, result in regulatory actions by the MAS, including revocation or suspension of license.

## Regulations on Moneylending Business

The Ministry of Law regulates the carrying on of the business of moneylending, the designation and control of a credit bureau, the collection, use and disclosure of borrower information and data under the Moneylenders Act 2008 (the 'MLA'). Unless a person is an excluded moneylender or exempt moneylender, a person carrying on the business of moneylending in Singapore would require a license. Since 2012, there has been a moratorium implemented on the issuance of new licenses.

The MLA (and accompanying regulatory instruments) sets out certain duties, conduct of business and other requirements that are applicable to licensed and exempt moneylenders under the MLA. Exempt moneylenders may be subject to conditions to comply with relevant requirements as if they were a licensee - for example, to comply with the Moneylenders (Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism) Rules 2009, which, among other things, sets out requirements relating to internal policies, procedures and controls, risk assessment, customer due diligence, suspicious transaction reporting, record keeping, audit and compliance.

## Regulations on Anti-money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism ('AML/CFT')

Regulated financial institutions must comply with all applicable AML/CFT obligations, including the relevant AML/CFT Notices and Guidelines issued by the MAS. Among other things, the AML/CFT Notices require financial institutions to put in place robust controls to detect and deter the flow of illicit funds through Singapore's financial system, identify and know their customers (including beneficial owners), conduct regular account reviews, and to monitor and report any suspicious transaction.

The primary AML/CFT legislation in Singapore that are of general application are the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act 1992 (the 'CDSA') and Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act 2002 (the 'TSOFA'). The CDSA provides for the confiscation of benefits derived from, and to combat, corruption, drug dealing and other serious crimes. Generally, the CDSA criminalizes the concealment or transfer of the benefits of criminal conduct as well as the knowing assistance of the concealment, transfer or retention of such benefits. The TSOFA criminalizes terrorism financing and prohibits any person in Singapore from dealing with or providing services to a terrorist entity, including those designated pursuant to the TSOFA. The CDSA and the TSOFA also require suspicious transaction reports to be lodged with the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office. If any person fails to lodge the requisite reports under the CDSA and the TSOFA, it may be subject to criminal liability. In addition, financial institutions, nonfinancial institutions and individuals in Singapore are required to comply with financial sanction requirements in relation to individuals and entities designated by the United Nations. The MAS gives effect to targeted financial sanctions under the UN Security Council Resolutions through certain regulations issued pursuant to section 192 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2022, which apply to all regulated financial institutions in Singapore.

## Table of Contents

## Regulations on Personal Data Protection

The Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the 'Singapore PDPA') generally requires organizations to provide notification and obtain consents prior to collection, use or disclosure of personal data, and to provide individuals with the right to access and correct their own personal data. Personal data refers to data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified from that data or other accessible information. Organizations have mandatory obligations to assess data breaches they suffer, and to notify the Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') and where applicable, the relevant individuals if the data breach is (or is likely to be) of a significant scale or resulting in (or is likely to result in) significant harm to individuals. Other obligations include accountability, protection, retention, and requirements around the overseas transfers of personal data.

In addition, Do-Not-Call ('DNC') requirements require organizations to check 'Do-Not-Call' registries prior to sending marketing messages addressed to Singapore telephone numbers, through voice calls, fax or text messages, unless clear and unambiguous consent to such marketing was obtained from the individual.

The PDPC may impose sanctions in connection with the improper collection, use and disclosure of personal data and certain failures to comply with the Singapore PDPA, including the DNC requirements. Organizations who contravene provisions of the Singapore PDPA may be liable for a financial penalty of up to SGD 1 million (approximately $736,000), or 10% of the organization's annual local turnover, whichever is higher, and/or imprisonment.

## Thailand

## Regulations on Foreign Business in Thailand

Foreign participation in business activities in Thailand is primarily regulated under the Foreign Business Act, B.E. 2542 (1999) (the 'FBA'). The FBA limits the rights of foreigners to engage in certain business activities in Thailand. Operating prohibited or restricted businesses in violation of the FBA may subject the violator to criminal charges and penalties.

The FBA defines 'aliens' or 'foreigners' as natural persons or juristic entities (such as companies, registered partnerships) who do not possess Thai nationality. The definition extends to companies registered in Thailand, in which 50% or more of the share capital belongs to foreign individuals or foreign juristic entities. The FBA also prohibits arrangements where a Thai national holds shares in a company as a nominee of a foreigner to circumvent the FBA.

The FBA and its schedules list the categories of controlled business activities, including activities for which foreigners are barred and activities in which foreigners can participate subject to certain limitations and with permissions from relevant authorities. A wide range of services (unless explicitly exempted by other applicable laws and regulations), including platform services and e-payment services, are restricted under the FBA. Therefore, foreign parties are not allowed to perform such services in Thailand without first obtaining the relevant foreign business license. The grant of a foreign business license is generally at the sole discretion of the Foreign Business Committee, and based on its current policy, the possibility that a foreign business license will be granted for a service business is generally limited.

Failure to comply with the aforementioned requirement could expose the offender and its responsible director to imprisonment not exceeding three years, or a fine of THB 100,000 to THB 1 million (approximately $3,000 to $29,000), or both. Additionally, the court is empowered to order the cessation of the business operation. Failure to comply with the court order could expose the offender and its responsible director to a daily fine at the rate of THB 10,000 to THB 50,000 (approximately $300 to $1,000) throughout the period of the violation.

Currently, our Thai subsidiaries are considered Thai companies under the FBA, and therefore are not subject to the foreign ownership restrictions under the FBA.

## Regulations on E-commerce

In Thailand, with effect from June 4, 2024, business operators who are exempting partnerships, limited partnerships, limited companies, and public limited companies conducting the sale and purchase of goods or services by electronic means via the Internet, including our mobility and deliveries offerings, are no longer subject to the Commercial Registration Act, B.E. 2499 (1956), as amended.

## Table of Contents

A business operator offering goods or services in Thailand by communicating information about the goods or services directly to consumers, at a distance (i.e., through the Grab platform), with the anticipation that the consumer will respond and purchase those goods or services, may be regarded as an operator of a direct marketing business under the Direct Sales and Direct Marketing Act, B.E. 2545 (2002), as amended (the 'Direct Marketing Act'). A direct marketing business operator must obtain a Direct Marketing Certificate from the Office of the Consumer Protection Board before commencing business. Failure to register as a direct marketing business operator prior to commencement of a direct marketing business could expose the offender and its responsible director to a fine of up to THB 100,000 (approximately $3,000), imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both. Additionally, the offender and its director could be subject to a daily fine of up to THB 10,000 (approximately $300) for a persistent offense.

Notwithstanding the legislative framework of Direct Marketing Act as described above, the competent authority interpreted the legislation to only regulate the offer and sale of tangible goods and products through online channels, and thus we are not in the position to obtain a Direct Market Certificate for the Grab platform. However, we received a Direct Marketing Certificate for GrabGift, our offering of e-vouchers, in March 2022. The competent authority has recently changed its interpretation to permit the registration of intangible services, such as the Grab platform. We have fully submitted the relevant application and anticipate receiving a Direct Marketing Certificate for the Grab platform by 2025.

## Regulations on the Supervision of Digital Platform Services

The Royal Decree on the Supervision of Digital Platform Service Businesses Subject to Prior Notification B.E. 2565 (2022) (the 'ETDA Law'), issued by the Electronic Transactions Development Agency (the 'ETDA'), was published in the Royal Gazette on December 23, 2022 and became effective on August 20, 2023. This regulation is aimed at regulating digital platform service providers who serve as electronic intermediary service providers connecting business operators with consumers, and requires applicable digital platform service providers to notify ETDA before commencing their businesses. Existing applicable digital platform service providers that wish to continue carrying on their businesses were required to notify ETDA by November 18, 2023. The ETDA Law also requires applicable digital platform service providers to comply with consumer protection obligations. In addition, ETDA may, based on the criteria prescribed under the ETDA Law, determine a digital platform service provider to be a 'large digital service platform business,' which will have to comply with any additional obligations, including but not limited to establishing risk management, system security and crisis management safeguards and measures, appointing a compliance officer, and being subject to third-party audits.

Failure to comply with the aforesaid notification obligation prior to commencement of business may result in criminal penalties, including a fine of up to THB 100,000 (approximately $3,000) and/or imprisonment for a term up to one year. In addition, failure to comply with the obligations as a digital platform service provider may result in suspension of the business or revocation of any notification already made.

We, as an existing applicable digital platform service provider, have notified the ETDA on October 31, 2023, under the categories of online marketplace for goods, online marketplace for services, and advertising service. We have received certifications of notification for all those categories.

## Regulations on Ride-hailing (GrabCar and JustGrab)

The Vehicle Act, B.E. 2522 (1979), as amended (the 'Thai Vehicle Act'), regulates the registration and use of vehicles in Thailand, and therefore applies to our mobility offerings such as GrabCar and JustGrab. The Thai Vehicle Act prescribes certain requirements concerning vehicles, such as with respect to registration, signage, annual taxation and vehicle use. The Thai Vehicle Act prohibits use of any vehicle other than in line with its purpose of use as registered with the Department of Land Transport. Such purposes of use include as a private vehicle, public vehicle or specific purpose specified by subregulation. On June 23, 2021, the primary regulation governing ride-hailing under the Thai Vehicle Act became effective, and it was later supplemented by subordinate regulations issued on various dates in 2021, 2022 and 2023. These regulations impose requirements on various aspects of ride-hailing, including (i) certification or registration of ride-hailing operators and drivers (with respect to their vehicles), (ii) pricing, (iii) on-boarding process of driver-partners, (iv) required decals to be placed on a ride-hailing vehicle, (v) a determination of engine power of ride-hailing vehicles, and (vi) conditions on taxis to use JustGrab, which determines upfront fare. With respect to (i), a ride-hailing operator or application is required to be certified by the Department of the Land Transport before commencement of its ride-hailing business, and, among other things, a certified ride-hailing operator shall only onboard drivers who fully comply with the aforesaid regulations, including having registered their vehicles and obtained public driving licenses. We obtained a ride-hailing operator certification in relation to our four-wheel and two-wheel vehicles on September 16, 2022.

Failure by a ride-hailing operator or application to comply with the regulations may result in revocation of its ride-hailing operator/application certification.

## Regulations on Payment Services

Under Thai law, domestic money transfer and payment services are regulated under the Payment Systems Act B.E. 2560 (2017) (the 'PSA') and its sub-regulations. Under the PSA, regulated payment services include the provision of: credit card, debit card, or ATM card services; electronic money services; receiving electronic payment for and on behalf of sellers, service providers or creditors; the service of transferring funds by electronic means; and other payment services that may affect the financial system or the public interest (as to be further announced by the Thai Ministry of Finance (the 'MOF')). Business operators intending to provide services that fall under the definition of such activities, including GrabPay Wallet and processing credit/debit card payment for Dine Out service, must obtain the relevant license from the MOF via the BOT prior to commencing the business. Operating a regulated payment service business without the required license or registration could result in penalties under the PSA (imprisonment for the term of two to 10 years or a fine of THB 200,000 to THB 1 million (approximately $6,000 to $29,000), or both).

In case of violations or failure to comply with the BOT regulations, business operators including their responsible persons may be subject to an administrative fine not exceeding THB 2 million (approximately $59,000). Whereas in the case of failing to operate a business or ceasing to operate a business accordingly, the MOF may revoke the license.

## Regulations on Nano-financing

Nano-finance businesses, which include our financial services business such as cash loans, are restricted businesses under the Notification of the Ministry of Finance Re: Business Subject to Approval under Section 5 of the Revolutionary Council Decree No. 58 and the Notification of the Bank of Thailand No. SorNorSor 13/2563 (collectively referred to as the 'Nano Finance Notifications'). 'Nano-finance' means lending, purchasing, discounting, or rediscounting bills or any negotiable instruments, or hire-purchase transactions or leasing to a natural person, without assets or property as collateral, with the borrower intending to use the money to carry on a business or for his/her occupation.

The Notification of the Bank of Thailand No. SorGorChor. 7/2566 regarding Responsible Lending ('RL Notification') was published in the Government Gazette on December 27, 2023, and became effective on January 1, 2024. The RL Notification applies to supervised personal loan and nanofinance business operators, establishing eight principles that service providers must comply with throughout the loan debt cycle. These principles cover: (i) development of loan products, (ii) advertising, (iii) sales practices, (iv) affordability, (v) promotion of financial discipline and financial management during the debt period, (vi) assistance to debtors with persistent debt, (vii) assistance to debtors who is facing the debt repayment difficulties and (viii) legal action and transfer of debtors to other creditors.

## Regulations on Personal Loans

Personal loan businesses, including cash loans, are restricted businesses under the Revolutionary Council Decree No. 58, as amended, the Notification of Ministry of Finance Re: Business Subject to Approval to Section 5 of the Revolutionary Council Decree No. 58, and the Notification of the Bank of Thailand No. SorNorSor 12/2563. A personal loan business operator must obtain an approval from the MOF through the BOT if the personal loans provided to its customers fall within the scope of 'personal loans under supervision' which include (i) personal loans without assets or property as collateral; (ii) lending originating from the hire-purchase and lease of goods that are not normally sold by the business operator (except for cars and motorcycles); and (iii) vehicle registration loan. The personal loan business operator is also subject to certain ongoing requirements and restrictions in business operation e.g. reporting requirements, chargeable fee, qualifications of customers.

If a non-compliant Nano-Finance and/or Personal Loan business operator cannot appropriately rectify the non-compliance activities, it may be ordered to cease business operations or be subject to a fine and penalty.

As above-mentioned in Regulations on Nano-financing, the RL Notification also applies to supervised personal loan operator.

## Regulations on Competition

The Trade Competition Act, B.E. 2560 (2017) (the 'Thai Trade Competition Act') is the primary legislation governing competitive interactions among business operators in Thailand. It applies to all business sectors, except certain types of business or activities that are specifically exempted, and the sectors that have already been regulated by specific laws on trade competition matters.

The Thai Trade Competition Act generally regulates all restrictive trade practices in all areas of business that create or might create a monopoly or reduce competition, or be an unfair practice, and also prohibits business operators from abusing their dominant position. Failure to comply with the Thai Trade Competition Act may result in either or both of a criminal penalty or administrative penalty depending on the severity of the offense as prescribed in the Thai Trade Competition Act. Criminal penalties may be up to 10% of the revenue in the year of offense or imprisonment for a term up to two years, or both. The director, manager or any person responsible for the company's operation would also be subject to similar fines. Administrative penalties may be up to (i) THB 6 million (approximately $176,000) and a daily fine penalty of THB 300,000 (approximately $9,000) for persistent offense, or (ii) 10% of revenue in the year of offense, depending on the type of the offense.

The Trade Competition Commission Thailand (the 'TCCT'), an independent body in charge of the supervision and enforcement of the Thai Trade Competition Act, has also published a sector-specific guideline on unfair trade practices for online food delivery businesses. The guideline regulates activities between food delivery platform operators and restaurants. The guideline contains a sweeping provision on free and fair treatment, referencing the principles of non-coercion, non-discrimination and non-restriction. A large section of the guideline is dedicated to laying out practices of food delivery platforms that may cause damage to restaurants, addressing trade terms that may exist in agreements between platforms and restaurants, for example, the increase of commission fees, or variation of commission fees, without justification, and exclusivity restrictions, among others. We are closely monitoring any new developments in TCCT's legislation in this respect to safeguard compliance. In the event of a failure to comply with the guideline, in addition to any applicable penalty under the Thai Trade Competition Act, the company will have to specifically correct its business practices (from the past and going forward) to comply with the TCCT's relevant decision. In addition, the relevant stakeholders (restaurants/competitors) may rely on the TCCT's decision as a basis to file civil lawsuits against the company for damages incurred.

## Regulations on the Price of Goods and Services

The Notification of the Central Committee on the Prices of Goods and Services No. 9, B.E. 2567 (2024) Re: Prescribing Controlled Goods and Services, which became effective on July 1, 2024, specifies that online delivery services such as GrabExpress, GrabFood and GrabMart are controlled services. However, a regulation regarding the price of online delivery services has not yet been issued by the relevant authority. Therefore, food and package delivery services may be subject to price controls once the regulations on controlling prices are issued. Failure to comply with the regulation regarding the price of online delivery service could expose the offender and its responsible director to a fine of up to THB 100,000 (approximately $3,000), or imprisonment of up to five years, or both.

## Regulations on Personal Data Protection

The Personal Data Protection Act 2019 (the 'Thailand PDPA') restricts the collection, use and disclosure of personal data by a data controller or a data processor, regardless of whether such collection, use, or disclosure takes place in Thailand or not. The application also applies to entities that are based outside of Thailand that collect, use, and/or disclose personal data of data subjects who are in Thailand. Principally, the organization is obligated to inform the data subject on the collection, use, and/or disclosure of personal data and obtain consent from data subject prior or at the time of such collection, use, and/or disclosure of personal data, unless it is permitted to do so by the provisions of the Thailand PDPA or any other laws. The organization that is processing the personal data is also required to provide appropriate security measures and put in place a system to erase or anonymize the personal data once the data is no longer needed for business or legal purposes. In the event of a data breach, the data controller is obligated to notify the authority and data subject if the breach poses a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the affected individual(s). Other obligations include requirements for cross-border transfers of personal data, record of data processing activities and appointment of a data protection officer.

In case of a breach of the Thailand PDPA, the Personal Data Protection Committee may impose an administrative fine of up to THB 5 million (approximately $147,000) and for criminal penalty, imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year and/or a fine of up to THB 1 million (approximately $29,000).

## Regulations on Debt Collection

Debt collection activity is regulated under the Debt Collection Act, B.E. 2558 (2015) (the 'Thai Debt Collection Act'), and accordingly, any debt collection on our lending products and PayLater are subject to this regulation. This regulation applies to all debt collectors and the method and procedures for debt collection are strictly regulated, and requires the debt collection service business operator to register its business with the Metropolitan Police Bureau or Department of Provincial Administration. Our subsidiary operating our debt collection service business has registered its business with the relevant authority.

Failure to comply with prescribed method and procedure for debt collection activities may result in administrative fines of up to THB 100,000 (approximately $3,000) or criminal penalties (fines of up to THB 500,000 (approximately $15,000) and/or imprisonment for a term up to five years). With respect to certain matters, the relevant authority may initially order cessation of such activities or rectification within a specified period. Failure to comply with an order would result in administrative fines. The registration of a debt collection service may be revoked in the event that such debt collection operator (i) has been repeatedly conducting the same non-compliant activities with administrative penalties, or (ii) violates any provision with criminal penalties under the regulation. Directors or officers who are responsible for such non-compliant activities by the company are also liable to penalties for such offense.

## Regulations of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism and Proliferation of Weapon of Mass Destruction Financing

The formation of the Civil Court's Online Sale Transaction Case Division was published in the Royal Gazette on December 20, 2021, under which a new division of the Thai Civil Court has been set up to resolve disputes in relation to online purchases. This new division, which officially commenced operation on January 27, 2022, allows consumers and/or purchasers to conveniently file lawsuits against sellers via an e-filing system without having to pay any court fee.

## Table of Contents

Due to the convenience of the new e-filing procedure, we may become involved in more litigation cases, whether as a witness or as a codefendant with the online seller. In those cases, we may be required to provide information per the court's request, failing which we may be subject to imprisonment of up to six months and/or a fine of up to THB 10,000 (approximately $300).

Electronic platforms are required to compile a 'special account' containing information on the revenue received from each business operator on their platform (e.g., driver-partners and merchant-partners) and submit it to the Revenue Department through the department's electronic reporting system within 150 days of the end of a fiscal year. This reporting requirement applies to electronic platforms registered in Thailand that have (or previously had, starting from the notification's effective date) annual revenue exceeding THB 1 billion (approximately $29.1 million), except for electronic platforms under the supervision of the Bank of Thailand or the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

## Regulations on Ride-hailing

The Land Public Transport Act 2010 ('LPTA'), the Commercial Vehicles Licensing Board Act 1987 ('CVLBA'), and the Road Transport Act 1987, each as amended, are the main pieces of legislation governing the provision of ride-hailing services such as GrabCar and GrabTaxi in Malaysia. The LPTA only applies to Peninsular Malaysia while the CVLBA applies to the East Malaysian States of Sabah, Sarawak and the Federal Territory of Labuan.

An operator of a ride-hailing booking service is required to have an intermediation business license which would allow it to carry on the business of facilitating arrangements, bookings or transactions of a ride-hailing service. An intermediation business licensee, such as us, is (i) required to apply for a permit for each ride-hailing vehicle; (ii) required to ensure that a valid PUSPAKOM (i.e., 'Pusat Pemeriksaan Kenderaan Komputer' or Computerized Vehicle Inspection Center) inspection certificate is visibly displayed in each ride-hailing vehicle; and (iii) subject to various other business limitations and requirements, including limitations on surcharge rates and driver-partner commissions and requirements such as ensuring that each driver-partner, ride-hailing vehicle and passenger is covered by ride-hailing insurance. In the event an operator does not acquire the intermediation business license, this will be deemed as an offense and upon conviction, the offender is liable to a fine of up to MYR 500,000 (approximately $112,000) and/or imprisonment for a term up to three years. In addition to the listed offense, the license may be revoked by the authority due to non-compliance. Separately, a driver-partner of ride-hailing vehicles is required to hold a public service vehicles ('PSV') license.

## Regulations on E-money

Under the Financial Services Act 2013 (the 'FSA'), no person may carry on an 'approved business' (which includes the issuance of e-money) without the prior approval of the Central Bank of Malaysia, Bank Negara Malaysia ('BNM'). Under the FSA, 'electronic money' or 'e-money' is defined as any payment instrument, whether tangible or intangible, that (a) stores funds electronically in exchange of funds paid to the issuer, and (b) is able to be used as a means of making payment to any person other than the issuer.

## Table of Contents

Approved issuers of e-money, such as us, are subject to various operational and ongoing compliance requirements including those set out in the 'Electronic Money (E-Money)' Policy Documents issued by BNM on January 31, 2025 ('E-Money Policy Document'). These requirements relate to governance, operational and risk management requirements, information technology requirements and regulatory processes. In particular, BNM has issued the Policy Document on Risk Management in Technology on June 1, 2023 and supplementary guidelines, which set out requirements in relation to cybersecurity and management of technology risk applicable to financial institutions including e-money issuers. An issuer of e-money is required to ensure that adequate security and operational safeguards are in place to mitigate any risks associated with the use of e-money within the specified wallet limit which must commensurate with the purpose and size of customer transactions, and non-bank e-money issuer shall deposit funds collected in exchange for the e-money issued in a trust account with a banking institution and ensure that funds in the trust account are at all times sufficient to cover the total outstanding e-money liabilities manner. In general, the funds deposited in the trust account can be used only for refunds to users, payments to merchants or payment to another emoney account or bank account arising from a credit transfer conducted by the customer. The E-Money Policy Document outlines requirements aimed at ensuring the safety and reliability of e-money and preserving customers' and merchants' confidence in using or accepting payments in e-money. Noncompliance with the above could result in penalties including loss of or restriction on the license, administrative financial penalties imposed by BNM, civil damages claims, and criminal penalties for the respective company and/or its officers up to and including fines and, in the case of officers, imprisonment for a term up to ten years.

## Regulations on Digital Banks

Our digital banking joint venture in Malaysia, namely GXBank, is a financial institution licensed by BNM under the Financial Services Act 2013 ('FSA') to carry on digital banking business under the foundational phase for a period of up to five years. GXBank is required to comply with the applicable provisions under the FSA and the requirements or standards specified pursuant to the FSA. During the foundational phase, GXBank's banking operations are subject to regulatory requirements as specified in the Licensing Framework for Digital Banks policy document issued by BNM. GXBank's business, affairs and activities are subject to sound risk management and governance practices as well as prudential standards that are applicable to a licensed digital bank. Noncompliance with these requirements may result in enforcement action being taken by BNM against the licensed digital bank, including revocation of the digital bank's license.

## Regulations on BNPL Services

In respect of the provision of buy now pay later ('BNPL') services, a task force, namely the Consumer Credit Oversight Board Task Force ('CCOB'), was set up in July 2021 to drive the enactment of an Act, namely the Consumer Credit Act, to regulate credit business and credit service business, which includes certain lending and BNPL services. The Consumer Credit Bill 2025 was tabled to Parliament for first reading on March 4, 2025. The CCOB's immediate focus will be on non-bank credit providers and service providers that are currently not subject to direct regulation by any authority.

Additionally, BNM has issued a policy document titled 'Personal Financing' on December 15, 2023 ('Personal Financing Policy Document'), which sets out certain guidelines in relation to the provision of personal financing products, such as BNPL services, by financial service providers ('FSP'). As an issuer of e-money, we are an FSP that is subject to the standards and guidelines set out in the Personal Financing Policy Document. An FSP who is seeking to offer personal financing products such as a BNPL arrangement to consumers is subject to certain standards such as: (i) the tenure of the personal financing product shall not exceed ten years; (ii) prior to granting BNPL to a financial consumer, an FSP shall assess the financial consumer's ability to make full repayment of the BNPL without resulting in undue financial hardship, which means that the FSP must at least consider the financial consumer's repayment history on existing credit facilities; (iii) for a financial consumer who does not have any credit repayment history, an FSP shall evaluate the financial consumer's repayment history on other recurring payment obligations, such as utility or telecommunication bills; (iv) an FSP shall not offer a BNPL facility to financial consumers who have been declared bankrupt; and (v) an FSP shall ensure that merchants do not set BNPL as the default payment option for financial consumers. Non-compliance with these standards may result in enforcement actions by BNM. An exposure draft of the Personal Financing policy document with proposed new regulatory requirements and expectations was issued on December 13, 2024 by BNM.

## Consumer Protection (Electronic Trade Transactions) Regulations 2024

The Consumer Protection (Electronic Trade Transactions) Regulations 2024 ('2024 Regulation') is the latest regulation issued under the Consumer Protection Act 1999, replacing the Consumer Protection (Electronic Trade Transactions) Regulations 2012. Effective from December 25, 2024, the 2024 Regulation applies to online marketplace where goods and services are traded or advertised, imposing obligations on both online marketplace operators and online marketplace suppliers to protect consumers' interests.

Under the 2024 Regulation, the online marketplace suppliers, such as merchants, must fulfil various obligations to enable consumers to make informed decisions. These include, without limitation, providing accurate and clear information about themselves, their products and services on the online marketplace; allowing consumers to rectify their orders; and bearing the cost of re-delivery for non-conforming goods. Online marketplace operators like Grab, on the other hand, must ensure, among other things, that required goods and services information is displayed on the marketplace, proper transaction records are maintained, and adequate grievance-handling procedures are in place. Any online marketplace operator or online marketplace suppliers who fail to comply with the 2024 Regulations commits an offense.

## Regulations on Moneylending

Under the Moneylenders Act 1951, no person may conduct business as a moneylender in Malaysia unless licensed under the Moneylenders Act 1951 or other relevant Malaysian legislation. Under the Moneylenders Act 1951, a 'moneylender' is defined as a person who carries on or advertises or announces himself or holds himself out in any way as carrying on the business of lending money at interest (with or without security) to a borrower, whether or not he carries on any other business. Licenses are issued by the Registrar of Moneylenders under the purview of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government ('KPKT').

A licensed moneylender is subject to operational and ongoing compliance requirements including, among others, the requirement to display at all times its original license in a conspicuous place at the premises where it carries out or operates its business, requirements in relation to the moneylending agreement (including in relation to its form and certain formalities required for the agreement to be enforceable) and record keeping requirements. KPKT has, on November 13, 2020, released the Online Moneylending Guidelines allowing licensed moneylenders to apply to provide loans online from May 13, 2021. We are one of eight licensed moneylenders which have been granted with conditional approval in November 2020 to conduct online moneylending business. Non-compliance with the above could potentially result in penalties including loss of or restriction on the license, administrative monetary penalties imposed by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, civil damages claims, and criminal penalties for the respective company and/or its officers up to and including fines and (in the case of officers) imprisonment for a term up to five years.

## Regulations on Insurance Agents

The primary legislation applicable to the carrying on of insurance business is the FSA which has repealed and replaced the Insurance Act 1996 ('Repealed IA'), save for certain provisions of the Repealed IA which shall continue to remain in full force and effect by virtue of section 275 of the FSA. The General Insurance Association of Malaysia ('PIAM') for general insurance agents has issued the rules for registration and regulation of general insurance agents (the 'GIARR'), which provides for regulations for supervision of general insurance agents by PIAM's members. Under the GIARR, among others, an insurance agent registered with PIAM may represent a maximum number of two general insurance companies at any time and shall comply with certain requirements of conduct. Non-compliance with the above could potentially result in penalties including loss of or restriction on the license, administrative monetary penalties imposed by BNM, civil damages claims, and criminal penalties for the respective company and/or its officers up to and including fines and (in the case of officers) imprisonment for a term up to ten years.

## Competition Law

The Competition Act 2010 applies to all commercial activities which have an effect on competition in any market in Malaysia, whether such activities are carried out within or outside Malaysia. The Competition Act 2010 is generally enforced by the Malaysia Competition Commission, save for competition issues arising in specific sectors (such as the telecommunications sector, the aviation sector and the energy sector, which are regulated by other regulators). Infringements of prohibitions of anti-competitive practices pursuant to Section 40 of the Competition Act 2010 may result in, among other things, the imposition of a financial penalty of up to 10% of the worldwide turnover of the enterprise for the period during which the infringement occurred. The Malaysia Competition Commission may also take other actions, including issuing cease-and-desist orders. The general penalty pursuant to Section 61 of the Competition Act 2010 is a (a) fine of up to MYR 5 million (approximately $1.1 million), and for a second or subsequent offense, to a fine of up to MYR 10 million (approximately $2.2 million); or (b) if such person is not a body corporate, to a fine of up to MYR 1 million (approximately $218,000) and/or imprisonment for a term up to five years, and for a second or subsequent offense, to a fine of up to MYR 2 million (approximately $435,000) and/or imprisonment for a term up to five years.

## Regulations on Personal Data Protection

The Personal Data Protection Act 2010, as amended in 2024 (the 'Malaysia PDPA'), sets out key data protection principles which data controllers must observe. These include (i) obtaining consent prior to processing an individual's personal data; (ii) providing written notices to individuals in both English and Malay; (iii) only disclosing personal data for the purposes for which consent was obtained; (iv) processing personal data in a safe and secure manner; (v) keeping personal data not longer than is necessary; (vi) taking reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is accurate; and (vii) providing data subjects access to their personal data.

Under the Malaysia PDPA, 'personal data' means any information in respect of commercial transactions, which (a) is processed wholly or partly by means of equipment operating automatically in response to instructions given for that purpose; (b) is recorded with the intention that it should wholly or partly be processed by means of such equipment; or (c) is recorded as part of a relevant filing system or with the intention that it should form part of a relevant filing system, that relates directly or indirectly to a data subject, who is identified or identifiable from that information or from that and other information in the possession of a data controller, including any sensitive personal data and expression of opinion about the data subject. However, it does not include any information that is processed for the purpose of a credit reporting business carried on by a credit reporting agency under the Credit Reporting Agencies Act 2010.

Further, the Malaysia PDPA provides that a data controller shall appoint one or more data protection officers who will be accountable to the data controller for the compliance with the Malaysia PDPA. The data controller shall notify the Personal Data Protection Commissioner ('Commissioner') on the appointment of data protection officer. Where a data controller has reason to believe that a personal data breach has occurred, the data controller shall, as soon as practicable, notify the Commissioner. Where such personal data breach causes or is likely to cause any significant harm to the data subject, the data controller shall notify the personal data breach to the data subject without unnecessary delay.

In case of a breach of the Malaysia PDPA, effective from April 1, 2025, the Personal Data Protection Commission may impose a fine of up to MYR 1,000,000 (approximately $224,000) and/or an imprisonment for a term of up to three years.

## Regulations on Anti-money Laundering and Prevention of Terrorism Financing

The Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 ('AMLATFA'), makes it an offense for any person to engage in or abet the commission of money laundering and terrorist financing, and seeks, among other things, to implement measures for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing offenses. These measures include the imposition of obligations on reporting institutions (including certain Grab entities in Malaysia) such as an obligation to report transactions exceeding a specified threshold and suspicious transactions, customer due diligence obligations and record keeping obligations. Reporting institutions under the AMLATFA include approved issuers of e-money under the FSA and licensed moneylenders under the Moneylenders Act 1951. BNM is empowered under Section 83 of the AMLATFA to issue guidelines, circulars or notices to give full effect to or for carrying out the provisions of the AMLATFA. In this regard, BNM has issued policy documents on anti-money laundering, countering financing of terrorism and targeted financial sanctions applicable to licensed moneylenders and approved issuers of e-money.

## Worker Classification

An 'employee' means a person engaged under a contract of service while an 'independent contractor' means a person engaged pursuant to a contract for services. There is no single legal test to determine whether a person is engaged as an employee or an independent contractor. The Employment (Amendment) Act 2022 (the 'EA') introduced a presumption as to who is an employee or an employer in the absence of a written contract of service relating to any category of employee within the ambit of the EA. The factors which would trigger the presumption include whether the manner of work or hours of work are subject to control, whether tools, materials or equipment to execute work is provided, whether the work constitutes an integral part of the business, whether the work is performed solely for the benefit of a person's business, or whether payment is made in return for work done at regular intervals and such payment constitutes the majority of a person's income. In determining the status of an employee or independent contractor, the Industrial Court of Malaysia will examine all facts and circumstances and the conduct of the parties, including but not limited to the aforesaid factors, whether there is a fixed compensation package or whether the individual undertook a business risk, exclusivity, whether any statutory contributions have been made, and the contractual terms of the engagement.

## The Philippines

## Regulation of Public Utilities and Other Related Matters

## Foreign Ownership Restriction

The Philippine Constitution restricts the operation of a public utility to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations organized under the laws of the Philippines at least 60% of whose capital is owned by such citizens. It also limits the participation of foreign investors in the governing body of any public utility to the foreign investors' proportionate share in its capital, and mandates that all the executive and managing officers of such public utility be citizens of the Philippines.

The Foreign Investments Act, as amended, defines a Philippine national as, among others, a citizen of the Philippines or a corporation organized under the laws of the Philippines of which at least sixty percent (60%) of the capital stock outstanding and entitled to vote is owned and held by citizens of the Philippines. Under Memorandum Circular No. 8, series of 2013 issued by the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Philippine SEC'), the minimum Filipino percentage of ownership applies to both (a) the total number of outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, and (b) the total number of outstanding shares of stock, whether or not entitled to vote in the election of directors.

Commonwealth Act No. 108, known as the Anti-Dummy Law ('ADL'), imposes imprisonment for a term up to 15 years, fine up to the value of the franchise, forfeiture of the franchise, and possible closure of business, upon, among others, (i) any entity exercising a right or franchise that is reserved for Philippine citizens or entities without complying with the required ownership by Philippine citizens, (ii) any person who allows his name or citizenship to be used for the purpose of evading such ownership requirement, or (iii) who falsely simulates the existence of the required minimum percentage of Philippine ownership. The ADL also penalizes persons, corporations or partnerships that allow foreigners to intervene in the management, control or administration of such entity and any person who knowingly aids, assists or abets in the planning, consummation or perpetration of such acts by imprisonment and/or fine.

Commonwealth Act No. 146, as amended (the 'Public Service Act'), lists common carriers in the definition of the term 'public service.' On March 21, 2022, Republic Act No. 11659 amending the Public Service Act was signed into law (the 'PSA Amendment'), and became effective in the following month. The PSA Amendment provides for an exclusive enumeration of what constitutes a public utility and states that '[n]o other person shall be deemed a public utility unless otherwise subsequently declared by law.' Under Section 4 of the PSA Amendment, only the following are public utilities: (i) distribution of electricity; (ii) transmission of electricity; (iii) petroleum and petroleum products pipeline transmission systems; (iv) water pipeline distribution systems and wastewater pipeline systems, including sewerage pipeline systems; (v) seaports; and (vi) public utility vehicles (but excluding transport vehicles accredited with and operating through TNCs such as TNVSs). The law expressly provides that '[n]otwithstanding any law to the contrary, nationality requirements shall not be imposed by the relevant administrative agencies on any public service not classified as a public utility.' Thus, those not classified as public utility are public services not subject to foreign ownership restrictions except those applicable to (i) entities controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign governments or foreign-state owned enterprises, and (ii) sovereign wealth funds and independent pensions funds of each state. Foreigners may fully own and control key industries across economic sectors except public utilities. The implementing rules to the PSA Amendment was published on March 20, 2023 and took effect on April 4, 2023.

## Table of Contents

Transport vehicles accredited with and operating through TNCs such as TNVSs are not considered as public utility vehicles and will therefore not fall under the category of public utilities. TNCs pertain to persons or entities that provide pre-arranged transportation services for compensation using an internet-based technology application or digital platform technology to connect passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles, while TNVS refers to a TNC-accredited private vehicle owner, which is a common carrier, using the internet-based technology application or digital platform technology, transporting passengers from one point to another, for compensation.

However, other public services may later on be classified as public utilities by congressional act. Particularly, the President may, upon recommendation of the National Economic and Development Authority ('NEDA'), recommend to Congress the classification of a public service as public utility on the basis for the following criteria: (i) the person or juridical entity regularly supplies and transmits and distributes to the public through a network a commodity or service of public consequence; (ii) the commodity or service is a natural monopoly that needs to be regulated when the common good so requires. For this purpose, natural monopoly exists when the market demand for a commodity or service can be supplied by a single entity at a lower cost than by two or more entities; (iii) the commodity or service is necessary for the maintenance of life and occupation of the public; and (iv) the commodity or service is obligated to provide adequate service to the public on demand.

The Philippine Constitution also restricts foreign participation in corporations engaged in advertising. Only Philippine citizens or corporations or associations at least 70% of the capital of which is owned by Philippine citizens are allowed to engage in advertising. Furthermore, the participation of foreign investors in the governing body of entities engaged in advertising is limited to their proportionate share in the capital of such entities, and all the executive and managing officers of such entities must be Philippine citizens.

## Ride-hailing Industry

Under Department of Transportation Order No. 2018-13 dated June 11, 2018, TNCs and the accredited TNVS are deemed as engaging in the operation of a public utility, and are thus subject to the foreign ownership restriction under the Philippine Constitution. This has been superseded, however, by the PSA Amendment, which effectively removed the foreign ownership restrictions for TNCs and transport vehicles accredited and operating through TNCs.

TNCs are required to secure a Certificate of TNC Accreditation from LTFRB, while TNVSs are required to secure a Certificate of Public Convenience from the LTFRB. Any violation or non-compliance by a TNC and a TNVS of any guidelines set by the LTFRB shall be a ground for imposition of administrative fines, suspension, or cancellation of accreditation.

On August 10, 2018, the DOTr imposed a moratorium on the acceptance of TNC Accreditation applications to allow for their careful study, and to allow the LTFRB to closely monitor the operation of existing TNCs. On November 12, 2021, the DOTr circulated Memorandum Circular No. 2021-066, lifting the moratorium on the entry of TNCs in the ride-hailing industry. The memorandum aims to encourage healthy competition among TNCs and imposes new requirements for accreditation, which include proof of financing, an accreditation fee of PHP 30,000 (approximately $500), and that 60% of the capital stock of applicant corporations be owned by Philippine citizens. With the effectiveness of the PSA Amendment, this 60% nationality requirement applicable to our ride sharing and express delivery should no longer apply. The provisions on Department of Transportation Order No. 2018-13 dated June 11, 2018 which provides that TNCs and the accredited TNVS are deemed as engaged in the operation of a public utility, and are thus subject to the foreign ownership restriction under the Philippine Constitution, has been expressly repealed by the PSA Amendment.

In LTFRB Memorandum Circular No. 2021-066 dated November 12, 2021, the LTFRB said that the Memorandum Circular issued on August 10, 2018 which suspended the acceptance of new applications for TNC accreditation is 'lifted' to give new entrants 'the opportunity to apply, thus, inviting healthy competition among TNCs.' Since such lifting, at least fourteen other companies have been accredited by the LTFRB as TNCs in the Philippines, including Angkas, Joyride, and Owto.

## Motorcycle-hailing Applications

Under Republic Act No. 4136 (the 'Land Transportation and Traffic Code'), motorcycles shall not be used for hire and shall not be used to solicit, accept, or be used to transport passengers or freight for pay. Further, the Omnibus Guidelines on the Planning and Identification of Public Road Transportation Services and Franchise Issuance dated June 19, 2017, of the Department of Transportation, exclude motorcycles from the allowable vehicles to be used as a TNVS. In 2019, the Motorcycle Taxi Technical Working Group ('TWG') implemented a pilot run for motorcycle taxis that ended in January 2020 but was resumed on November 23, 2020. There is currently no official end date of the pilot. The Certificate of Compliance issued to motorcycle TNCs, including for our two-wheel mobility offerings, will be valid for the duration of the pilot run unless sooner revoked. In Department Order (DO) No. 2022-021, Department of Transportation, under the new administration following the 2022 Presidential elections, reconstituted and reconvened the TWG to oversee and monitor the continuous pilot implementation of motorcycle taxi operations. As of December 2023, the TWG is considering expanding the pilot to cover more key cities and provinces, and to include more companies in the pilot study.

In May 2024, the TWG recommended to Congress the integration of motorcycle taxis as a safe and viable means of public transportation. The House of Representatives has approved House Bill No. 10424, or the proposed Motorcycle-for-Hire Act, which allows the operation of motorcycles for the transportation of passengers and goods, including parcels and mail. Its Senate counterpart, however, is pending before the Senate Committee on Public Services. Any violation or non-compliance with Land Transportation Traffic Code or any guidelines set by the LTO shall be a basis for imposition of administrative fines, impounding of the vehicle, and imprisonment. In December 2024, the LTFRB issued a show-cause order to MoveIt to explain why it should not be suspended or removed from the government's ongoing motorcycle taxi pilot study for allegedly exceeding the allocated rider cap and failing to report the activation, deactivation, and reactivation of its riders.

## Private Express and/or Messenger Delivery Service ('PEMEDES')

Presidential Decree No. 240 issued on July 9, 1973 states that no express and/or messenger delivery service firm shall operate in the Philippines without possessing 'Authority to Operate and/or Messenger Delivery Service' to be issued by the Postmaster General (now the Department of Information and Communications Technology, or the DICT). By virtue of Republic Act No. 7354, or the Postal Service Act of 1992, the Department of Transportation and Communications ('DOTC') (whose functions relating to the operation and maintenance of a national postal system including delivery services are transferred to the DICT) was given the exclusive power and authority to regulate the postal delivery services industry or those engaged in domestic postal commerce, including the registration and prequalification of any natural or juridical person, other than freight forwarders, who engage in the business of letter and parcel messengerial services, door-to-door delivery, or the transporting of the property of others that are similar to mail or parcel. 'Mail' or 'mail matters' refer to all matters authorized by the government to be delivered through the postal service and shall include letters, parcels, printed materials, and money orders. 'Parcel' means a rectangular box, the dimension and weight of which is as specified by the Philippine Postal Corporation or the government containing goods or some form of transportable property intended for delivery to an addressee prominently displayed on at least one of its sides.

Under DOTC Department Circular No. 2001-01 ('DC 2001-01'), which the DICT adopted, an 'Express and/or Messengerial Delivery Service Firm' is defined as a firm that owns, operates, manages or controls in the Philippines, for hire or compensation, with general or limited clientele, whether permanent, occasional or accidental, and for general business purposes, any service for the personal delivery to other persons, of written messages and any mail matter, except telegram. The DICT has proposed revised rules in processing, hearing, and adjudicating applications for authority to operate PEMEDES and the investigation of complaints in connection with the operation of such services. DC 2001-01 provides that only Philippine citizens or entities at least 60% of whose capital stock is owned by Philippine citizens may apply to operate a PEMEDES. The holder of a PEMEDES license is prohibited from leasing, transferring, selling, or assigning its rights, unless it obtains the approval of the DICT Secretary. Every operator of PEMEDES must also secure from the DICT a Messenger's Work License for every person it employs as a messenger. The Messenger's Work License will be valid for two years and may be renewed for the same period after the messenger concerned is ascertained to have no derogatory record.

Any violation or non-compliance by a PEMEDES of any guidelines set by the DICT shall be a ground for imposition of administrative fines and revocation of authority.

## Table of Contents

On April 8, 2022, the DICT issued Department Circular No. 001 series of 2022 to rationalize, streamline and liberalize the registration, regulation and monitoring of qualified PEMEDES operators. Under the said circular, the Postal Regulation Division ('PRD') was restructured into the ICT Infrastructure and Services Enabling Division ('IISED') and placed under the direct control and supervision of the Office of the Undersecretary of Digital Philippines ('OUDP'), which is mandated to lead in accelerating the promotion, liberalization, rationalization, and streamlining of the registration/accreditation, monitoring, and regulation of ICT infrastructure and services. The Committee on Postal Regulation was dissolved and its duties, powers, functions and responsibilities are now exercised by the OUDP through the IISED. The IISED shall undertake the processing and evaluation of applications for registration/accreditation of PEMEDES operators, and their subsequent monitoring and regulation.

## Regulations on E-marketplace operators

Republic Act No. 11967, or the Internet Transactions Act ('ITA'), took effect on December 20, 2023 with an 18-month transitory period for affected online merchants, e-retailers, e-marketplaces, and other digital platforms to comply with the new requirements. Save for certain exceptions, the ITA governs all business-to-business and business-to-consumer internet transactions where one of the parties is situated in the Philippines or where the online merchant, e-retailer, e-marketplace or digital platform is availing of the Philippine market and has minimum contacts in the market.

E-marketplace refers to digital platforms whose business is to connect online consumers with online merchants, facilitate and conclude sales, process the payment of products, goods or services through the platform, facilitate the shipment of goods or provide logistics services and post-purchase support within such platforms, and otherwise retains oversight over the consummation of the transaction. An internet transaction refers to the sale or lease of digital or non-digital goods and services over the internet. Our GrabFood and GrabMart offerings in the Philippines are subject to the ITA.

The ITA impose obligations on e-marketplaces including: (a) ensuring that the internet transactions on their platform: (i) are clearly identifiable as an e-commerce transaction; (ii) identifying the persons on whose behalf the e-commerce transaction is made; and (iii) identifying any promotional offer, and that conditions required to qualify for it are accessible, clear, and unambiguous; (b) requiring, as far as practicable, all online merchants, whether foreign or Filipino, to submit certain information before listing with their platforms and publishing the same on the platform; (c) maintaining a list of all online merchants registered under their platform; (d) taking the necessary precautions to protect the data privacy of consumers; (e) prohibiting the sale of regulated goods unless they provide the necessary permits and license information, and contractually obligating their compliance with sale procedures and limitations; (f) providing an effective and responsive redress mechanism for online consumers and online merchants to report a user or information posted on the platform that are deemed in violation of relevant laws; and (g) requiring all online merchants to clearly indicate the name and brand of the goods or services, price, description, and condition in their product offers online, regardless of the nature of the goods and services.

E-marketplaces and digital platforms facilitating such transactions are subsidiarily liable if they fail to meet obligations, including exercising diligence, promptly addressing intellectual property infringements, or providing contact details of online merchants without legal presence in the Philippines.

E-marketplaces or digital platforms shall be solidarily liable if it fails, after notice, to act expeditiously to remove, or disable access to goods or services appearing on its platform that are prohibited by law, imminently injurious, unsafe, or dangerous. E-marketplaces or digital platforms will not be held liable for their reliance in good faith on an online merchant's representations, warranties, or submitted registration documents even if such information or documents are later proved to be inaccurate, false, or untrue. However, the e-marketplace or digital platform must show evidence of good faith and that reasonable effort was exerted to ascertain and maintain the accuracy, authenticity and veracity of the documents or information submitted.

## Regulations on Electronic Money Issuers and Payment Services Operators

The BSP, or the central monetary authority of the Philippines, regulates the issuance of electronic money and the operations of electronic money issuers ("EMIs") such as payments due to our GrabPay offering in the Philippines. BSP Circular No. 1166, series of 2023 ('EMI Circular') defines E-money as referring to an electronically-stored monetary value that is: (i) maintained in a non-interest-bearing non-deposit transaction account; (ii) denominated in or pegged to Philippine Peso or other foreign currencies; (iii) pre-funded by customers to enable payment transactions; (iv) accepted as a means of payment by the issuer and by other persons or entities including merchants/sellers; (v) issued against receipt of funds of an amount equal to the monetary value issued; (vi) represented by a claim on its issuer; and (vii) withdrawable in cash or cash equivalent or transferable to other accounts/instruments that are withdrawable in cash. Prior BSP approval is required before operating as an EMI. Any violation of or non-compliance with the National Payments Act or any guidelines set by the BSP shall be a basis for imposition of administrative or civil fines of up to PHP 2 million (approximately $35,000), suspension of directors and officers, revocation of authority, and possible imprisonment for a term up to 10 years.

The BSP, in its Resolution No. 1400 dated December 5, 2024, approved the lifting of the three-year moratorium on the issuance of EMI licenses to non-banks effective December 16, 2024. The moratorium did not affect existing EMI license holders such as GrabPay.

Under the EMI Circular, EMIs are classified as 'large scale' or 'small scale,' depending on whether or not the 12-month average value of aggregated inflow and outflow transactions is equal to or greater than PHP 25 billion (approximately $451.3 million). The EMI Circular requires, among other things, 'large scale EMIs' to have a minimum capitalization of PHP 200 million (approximately $3.5 million), and 'small scale EMIs' to have a minimum capitalization of PHP100 million (approximately $1.7 million). The EMI Circular also requires EMIs to comply with BSP regulations related to electronic payment and financial services, including anti-money laundering and corporate governance measures. Furthermore, the EMI Circular imposes stricter disclosure, notification and reporting obligations on EMIs.

## Regulations on Financing Companies

Republic Act No. 5980, as amended (the 'Financing Company Act'), requires financing companies to secure the respective license from the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines (the 'Philippine SEC'). Financing companies refer to 'corporations, except banks, investments houses, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, cooperatives, and other financial institutions organized or operating under other special laws, which are primarily organized for the purpose of extending credit facilities to consumers and to industrial, commercial, or agricultural enterprises, by direct lending or by discounting or factoring commercial papers or accounts receivable, by buying and selling contracts, leases, chattel mortgages, or other evidences of indebtedness, or by financial leasing of movable as well as immovable property.' Accordingly, our lending offerings are subject to the Financing Company Act. There are no foreign equity restrictions applicable to financing companies.

The Financing Company Act authorizes the Philippine SEC to regulate financing companies, including the maximum rate or rates of purchase discounts, lease rentals, fees, service and other charges of financing companies, and to change, eliminate or grant exemptions from or suspend the effectivity of such rules whenever warranted by prevailing economic and social conditions. The said law also regulates the minimum paid-up capital of financing companies. Any violation of or non-compliance with the Financing Company Act or any guidelines set by the Philippine SEC shall be a basis for imposition of administrative fines of up to PHP 100,000 (approximately $2,000), imprisonment for a term up to six months, and revocation of authority.

On December 22, 2021, the BSP issued BSP Circular No. 1133, series of 2021, which imposes ceilings on interest rates and other fees charged by lending companies, financing companies, including their online lending platforms. This policy intends to cover short term, small value, and high-cost consumer credit targeting primarily the low-income borrowers. Therefore, unsecured, general-purpose loans offered by lending companies, financing companies, and their online lending platforms, that do not exceed the amount of PHP 10,000 (approximately $200) and loan tenor of up to four months shall be subject to the prescribed ceilings on interest rates and other fees. Non-compliance with the ceilings imposed may result in the imposition of a fine of PHP 50,000 (approximately $900) for the first offense, PHP 100,000 (approximately $2,000) for the second offense, and PHP 1 million (approximately $17,000) for the third offense. For the third offense, potential penalties also include suspension of financing activities, and revocation of the certificate of authority to operate as a financing company.

## Table of Contents

On March 1, 2022, the Philippine SEC issued SEC Memorandum Circular No. 3, series of 2022, which requires all financing companies and lending companies, whether or not offering loans covered by the ceiling on interest rates, to submit an impact evaluation report on or before January 15 of each year beginning in 2023 using the form prescribed in the SEC website. It also requires financing companies and lending companies to submit a business plan indicating the company's loan products and services as well as the applicable pricing parameters within 60 days from the date of issuance of their certificate of authority to operate. Noncompliance with the requirements may result in the imposition of administrative fines, suspension or revocation of the certificate of authority to operate.

## Moratorium on Online Lending Platform

Due to numerous complaints related to alleged violations of existing regulations by online lending platforms, the Philippine SEC, through Memorandum Circular No. 10, series of 2021 dated November 2, 2021, imposed a moratorium on the registration of new online lending platforms, including existing financing companies and lending companies that will engage in online lending platforms. Under the said SEC Memorandum Circular, only the recorded lending and financing companies with online lending platforms as of November 2, 2021 (including a subsidiary of Grab) may operate and be used for online lending or financing, which shall be subject to strict monitoring by the Philippine SEC of their compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The moratorium will be in effect until it is formally lifted by the Philippine SEC.

## Regulations on Operators of Payment Systems

Republic Act No. 11127 (the 'National Payment Systems Act') provides a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework for payment systems and governs services such as GrabPay and GrabLink. The law defines "payment systems" as the set of payment instructions, processes, procedures and participants that ensure the circulation of money or the movement of funds, and "operators" as persons who provide clearing or settlement services in a payment system or define, prescribe, design, control, or maintain the operational framework of the payment system. All operators of payment systems ('OPS') must register with the BSP. BSP Circular No. 1049 issued on September 9, 2019 provides for the rules and regulations on the registration of OPS to implement the National Payment Systems Act. Any violation of or non-compliance with the National Payments Act or any guidelines set by the BSP shall be a basis for imposition of administrative or civil fines of up to PHP 2 million (approximately $35,000), suspension of directors and officers, revocation of authority, and/or imprisonment for a term up to 10 years.

On September 17, 2021, the BSP issued BSP Circular No. 1127, series of 2021, which provides for the governance policy for OPS as part of the implementation of the National Payment Systems Act. Under the said BSP Circular, all OPS are required to comply with a risk appetite statement which details the types of risks OPS are willing to accept and avoid in order to keep their business objectives. This should include statements that report measures on systemic, financial, and operation risks that could build up in the payment system in the course of their business. A risk governance framework that lays out the business strategy that will be adopted by a firm's board of directors is also required. OPS are also required to have a board of directors composed of five to fifteen members, wherein one of them or at least 20% of the board should be independent directors.

On March 1, 2022, the BSP issued BSP Circular No. 1138, Series of 2022, which provides for the regulatory reporting standards for OPS. Under the regulations, an OPS must have in place a reporting system which follows minimum functionalities required by the BSP under both business-as-usual and stressed conditions. Non-compliance with the reporting standards could result in the imposition of monetary sanctions against the OPS and sanctions against the officers and/or the board of the OPS.

The BSP issued the first Manual of Regulations for Payment Systems ('MORPS') in 2023 which consolidated payment system regulations, including the services, processes, and responsibilities of the participants.

BSP Circular No. 1198, series of 2024, which took effect on August 8, 2024, provides that the Monetary Board, in its Resolution No. 806 dated July 11, 2024, approved the Regulatory Framework for Merchant Payment Acceptance Activities ('MPAA') which aims to establish standards and best practices to safeguard customer funds and protect merchants' rights in dealings with OPS engaged in MPAA. 'MPAA' refers to the set of services provided to a merchant to receive payment for sale of goods and/or services, which include merchant acquisition, providing the means to accept various payment instruments and collect, secure, transmit and process payment information, and providing support services related to the payment. An OPS is considered engaged in MPAA in the Philippines if the OPS, merchant, or both are located in the Philippines.

## Table of Contents

- · OPS that engage in MPAA or intends to engage in merchant acquisition must obtain a Merchant Acquisition License (MAL) from the BSP and comply with minimum capital requirements based on the entity's average monthly value of collected funds transferred to merchants.
- · OPS that engage in MPAA or intends to engage in MPAA other than merchant acquisition must also register with the BSP under existing regulations governing OPS.

An OPS engaged in or intending to engage in MPAA that has a concurrent banking or EMI-NBFI license is expected to adhere to the more stringent requirements between the guidelines under BSP Circular No. 1198 and the applicable provisions of the Manual of Regulations for Banks ('MORB') and the Manual of Regulations for Non-Bank Financial Institutions ('MORNBFI'), as applicable, to satisfy the overall regulatory expectations of the BSP, including regulations on payments to merchants, pricing mechanism, and reportorial requirements. BSP Circular No. 1198 also provides for special rules related to settlement, operations, information technology, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing, counter-proliferation financing of weapons of mass destruction, and end-user protection.

## Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001, as amended

Republic Act No. 9160 (Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001), as amended (the 'AMLA'), requires covered institutions which include banks, non-banks, quasi-banks, trust entities, and all other institutions and their subsidiaries and affiliates supervised or regulated by the BSP, to provide for customer identification, keep records, and report covered and suspicious transactions. Covered persons are also required to report to the Anti-Money Laundering Council covered transactions and suspicious transactions. Violations of the AMLA may lead to administrative and criminal penalties. Each of the BSP, the Philippine SEC and the Insurance Commission has also issued its own set of regulations implementing the AMLA to cover institutions under their respective supervision.

## Regulations on Insurance

The applicable laws governing insurance contracts and matters related to insurance business are Republic Act No. 10607 (the 'Insurance Code') and the Civil Code of the Philippines. The Insurance Code mandates that only persons duly licensed by the Insurance Commission, such as insurance agents and brokers, may engage in the solicitation or procurement of applications for insurance. No person shall act as an insurance agent unless they have first secured from the Insurance Commission a license to act as an insurance agent, which must be renewed every three years thereafter. Acting as an insurance agent without authority is unlawful and is penalized by fine of up to PHP 250,000 (approximately $4,000) and/or imprisonment for a term up to six months. Microinsurance agents/brokers must likewise be licensed by the Insurance Commission and must comply with Insurance Commission Circular Letter No. 2015-54 dated October 16, 2015 (Adoption and Implementation of Enhanced Microinsurance Regulatory Framework).

## Regulations on Personal Data Protection

Republic Act No. 10173 (the 'Data Privacy Act of 2012' or the 'DPA'), its Implementing Rules and Regulations ('IRR)', and the issuances of the National Privacy Commission (the 'NPC') govern the processing of all types of personal and sensitive personal information (collectively, 'personal data'). The DPA applies to any natural or juridical person involved in the personal information processing such as personal information controllers and processors who, although not found or established in the Philippines, process the personal data of Philippine residents or citizens, use equipment that are located in the Philippines, or those who maintain an office, branch or agency in the Philippines, subject to certain exceptions. The DPA expressly requires that, before a personal information controller (the 'PIC') or processor (the 'PIP') can collate, process, and then use or share personal data, the PIC must have a lawful criterion or basis for processing, such as consent (which is defined as any freely given, specific, informed indication of will, whereby the data subject agrees to the collection and processing of his or her personal data) and contract fulfillment.

The DPA and its IRR require PICs and PIPs to have a data protection officer or compliance officer. A PIC or PIP must also register their data processing systems with the NPC if (i) its data processing system is operating in the Philippines; and, (ii) the processing meets any of the following conditions: (a) it employs at least 250 persons, (b) it employs less than 250 persons but the processing undertaken is likely to pose a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject or is not occasional, (c) it involves the processing of sensitive personal information of at least 1,000 individuals or (d) the processing involves automated decision making or profiling, pursuant to NPC Circular No. 2022-04. The data protection officer or compliance officer shall be accountable for ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations for the protection of data privacy and security.

## Table of Contents

In the course of their data processing activities, PICs and PIPs must implement appropriate technical, physical and organizational security measures including the conduct of privacy impact assessments, whenever applicable.

PICs and PIPs are also required to constitute a data breach response team. The team must be ready to assess and evaluate security incidents and data breaches, restore integrity to the information and communications system, mitigate and remediate any resulting damage, and comply with data breach reporting requirements and proper documentation under NPC Circular No. 2016-03.

The NPC may impose administrative fines for data privacy infractions committed by PICs and PIPs. Fines range from 0.5% to 3% of the annual gross income of such controllers or processors for grave violations, 0.25% to 2% of such income for major violations, and PHP 50,000 (approximately $1,000) to PHP 200,000 (approximately $3,500) for other violations. In addition, courts of law may impose a maximum penalty of up to PHP 5 million (approximately $86,400) and/or imprisonment for a term up to seven years for data privacy violations.

## Regulations on Cybersecurity

BSP Circular No. 808, Series of 2013 provides for the guidelines on technology risk management applicable to all BSP-supervised institutions and requires BSP supervised institutions to establish a robust technology risk management system covering the following components: (i) technology governance, (ii) risk identification and assessment, (iii) technology control implementation, and (iv) risk measurement and monitoring.

Insurance Commission Circular Letter No. 2014-47 (Guidelines on Electronic Commerce of Insurance Products) requires insurance providers to comply with the DPA, maintain adequate security mechanisms to ensure security of payment mechanisms and personal information, and provides guidelines on the collection and processing of data. The Insurance Commission may order insurance providers to cease conducting online distribution of insurance products in case of a finding of fraud and injury to the public.

## Regulations on Competition Law

The Philippine Competition Act (the 'PCA') is the primary competition policy of the Philippines. It came into effect on August 8, 2015, and was enacted to provide free and fair competition in trade, industry and all commercial economic activities. The PCA prohibits practices that restrict market competition through anti-competitive agreements or conduct and abuse of a dominant position, and requires parties to notify and obtain clearance for certain mergers and acquisitions. The PCA prescribes administrative fines of up to PHP 275 million (approximately $4.8 million) and criminal penalties of imprisonment for a term up to seven years for violations of its provisions.

The PCA also requires compulsory notification of mergers and acquisitions which meet certain thresholds. Starting on March 1, 2024, the new thresholds are PHP 7.8 billion (approximately $135 million) for the 'size of party test' and PHP 3.2 billion (approximately $55 million) for the 'size of transaction test.' These thresholds are subject to annual adjustment based on the growth of nominal Gross Domestic Product of the Philippines.

Furthermore, the PCC has the power to review, at its own discretion, mergers and acquisitions which it believes, based on reasonable grounds, are likely to substantially prevent, restrict or lessen competition in the market.

## Regulations on Employment

## Independent Contractor

Contracting and subcontracting of work is allowed but is heavily regulated by the Philippine Labor Code and Department of Labor and Employment Department Order No. 174, series of 2017. There is legitimate contracting where the contractor (i) conducts an independent business, (ii) with adequate capital to do the job and pay its people, and (iii) exercises direct control over the performance of the workers. 'Control' refers to the right reserved to the person for whom the services of the contractual workers are performed, to determine not only the end to be achieved, but also the manner and means to be used in reaching that end. On the other hand, the law prohibits labor-only contracting, which is where the person supplying workers to an employer does not have substantial capital or investment, and the workers recruited and placed by such contractor/subcontractor are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of such employer, or when the contractor or subcontractor does not exercise the right to control over the performance of the work of the employee. In such cases, the contractor, subcontractor, or intermediary shall be considered merely as an agent of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him.

Foreign investment into Vietnam is regulated by both domestic legislation and international agreements, with the primary regulations being Law on Investment No. 61/2020/QH14 (as amended in 2022 and 2024), and the Schedule of Specific Commitments in Services in Vietnam's Commitments to the WTO (the 'WTO Commitments'). Foreign investment is divided into three general categories: unrestricted, restricted, and prohibited. With respect to the 'restricted' category, restrictions can take the form of a specific foreign ownership ceiling in a foreign-invested company, a general requirement to enter into a joint venture with a local party in order to conduct the relevant business, restrictions on the scope of investment activities, the requirement to obtain certain government approvals for foreign ownership, operational license requirements for foreign invested enterprises ('FIEs'), or a combination thereof. For example, foreign ownership in companies providing passenger transport services is subject to a 49% ceiling, and foreign ownership in companies engaging in e-payment or debt trading businesses is not specifically provided for in either domestic legislation or the WTO Commitments and is therefore subject to government approval on a case-by-case basis.

Any investment activities which are not compliant with the Law on Investment and its sub-law guidance may cause a company to be subject to fines and certain remedial measures. For example, investing in any prohibited business sectors may lead to a fine of up to VND 300 million (approximately $12,000), compulsory termination of the investment activities and return of illegitimate profits earned from such violated activities.

## Regulations on Core Business Activities

## Mobility Segment

## Registration or Notification of E-Commerce Websites and Mobile Applications

Under Decree No. 52/2013/ND-CP guiding e-commerce (as amended in 2018 and 2021) ('Decree 52'), and Circular 59/2015/TT-BCT as amended in 2018 and in 2022 ('Circular 59'), there are two forms of e-commerce operation in Vietnam: (i) e-commerce direct sale websites or mobile applications, and (ii) e-commerce service provision websites or mobile applications, such as e-commerce marketplace websites or mobile applications, online auction websites or mobile applications, and online promotional marketplace websites or mobile applications. The establishment and operation of e-commerce websites or mobile applications require regulatory approvals from the Ministry of Industry and Trade (the 'MOIT') of Vietnam. In particular, companies that own or operate e-commerce direct sale websites or mobile applications must notify the MOIT of the establishment of such e-commerce direct sale websites or mobile applications while companies that own or operate e-commerce service provision websites or mobile applications must register with the MOIT for their establishment. If there are any changes or supplements to the services provided via the registered or notified e-commerce website or mobile application, the operator of such website or mobile application must notify the MOIT of Vietnam within seven business days. Accordingly, our two-wheel mobility, GrabFood, GrabMart, GrabGifts, Rewards and Dine Out offerings are subject to Decree 52 and Circular 59.

Failure to comply with the aforesaid registration or notification procedures, as applicable, may result in the imposition of a fine of up to VND 60 million (approximately $2,000).

## Table of Contents

Decree No. 09/2018/ND-CP, which sets forth regulations on Law on Commerce and Law on Foreign Trade Management on trading goods and activities directly related to trading of goods of foreign investors and FIEs in Vietnam ('Decree 09'), expressly requires a trading license for FIEs engaging in certain trading activities and e-commerce activities including, among others: (i) retail of goods, (ii) provision of trade promotion services, except advertisement, (iii) provision of trading intermediary services and (iv) e-commerce services. The relevant authority for issuing the trading license is the provincial Department of Industry and Trade ('DOIT'), where the FIE's head office is located. For issuance of the trading license, the DOIT must seek approval from the MOIT. The initial term of a trading license is generally five years unless another term is applicable pursuant to treaty. Accordingly, our GrabFood and GrabMart are subject to Decree 09.

Decree 09 also provides an exemption from the requirement to obtain a trading license for FIEs which have obtained an enterprise registration certificate, an investment registration certificate or equivalent documents prior to the effective date of Decree 09 for their trading rights in accordance with Vietnamese law. Those FIEs can continue carrying out their trading activities as previously approved but certain changes including, among others, scope of trading operations, shareholding or legal representative could require the company to apply for a trading license. Due to changes in enterprise information, which requires obtaining a trading license, we are in the process of obtaining one under Decree 09. Failure to obtain a trading license may result in a fine of up to VND 30 million (approximately $1,000) and/or return of all the profits earned from activities conducted without a proper license.

Starting on January 1, 2022, foreign investment in e-commerce is subject to discretionary approval of competent licensing authorities (in contrast to 'matter of course' approval). In particular, (i) a foreign investor can invest in e-commerce services by either setting up a new entity or acquiring shares/equity interest of an existing e-commerce entity; and (ii) in addition to consensus of the MOIT, an appraisal of the Ministry of Public Security ('MPS') is also required for national security purpose if the foreign investor currently has 'control' in at least one e-commerce entity holding a 'top 5' position in the Vietnam e-commerce market as announced by the MOIT. However, the MOIT has not announced such top 5 list as of the date of this annual report.

In addition, for an existing Vietnam-based e-commerce company that holds a 'top 5' position in the Vietnam e-commerce market, a similar MPS approval is required before MOIT gives its consensus and the DOIT grants or amends the trading license. The amendment to the trading license is required if there is any change in registered contents such as entity's name, business identification number, address of headquarters, legal representative, controlling owners, capital contributors, founding shareholders. This additional provision may result in additional time and effort for leading e-commerce businesses in its licensing process.

With regard to the above regulations, it seems that the MPS approval is required only with respect to investments with acquisition of 'control' over an existing e-commerce entity holding a 'top 5' position in the Vietnam e-commerce market.

## Automobile Transport Services

Starting from April 1, 2020, any company who provides a software application supporting automobile transport connection, which includes our four-wheel offerings, shall be regulated by Decree No. 10/2020/ND-CP on automobile transport business and business conditions, as amended in 2022, which was replaced by Decree No. 158/2024/ND-CP on road transport activities ('Decree 158'), effective from January 1, 2025. Under Decree 158, if a software application company is directly involved in deciding the transport booking fares, the relevant company is required to obtain an automobile transport business license as issued by the provincial Department of Transport where its head office is located. Decree 158 further provides that in the case two or more transport service providers cooperate to operate a transport business, they must enter into a business cooperation agreement which specifies the responsibilities of the parties, including with respect to direct management of automobile vehicles and drivers for freight and passenger transport and booking fares.

Conducting an automobile transport business without an automobile transport business license shall be subject to fines of up to VND 24 million (approximately $1,000). The automobile transport business license shall be revoked if the transport service provider fails to operate transport activities within six months from the issuance date of such license, or has commenced the operation but it is halted for six consecutive months.

## Motorcycle Transport Service

Under the Law on Road 2024, which took effect on January 1, 2025, individuals are entitled to use motorcycles to provide freight and passenger transport services, such as our two-wheel mobility services, GrabFood, GrabMart, and GrabExpress, and must comply with regulations on road traffic order and safety. Furthermore, companies providing software services for motorcycle transport connections must comply with, among others, regulations on ecommerce and electronic transactions. Therefore, Decree 52 and the Law on E-Transactions 2024, as detailed further hereunder, apply to this activity. These regulations will be enforced in case of non-compliance.

## Collection of Payment for Booked Goods and Services by Users

For our mobility and food delivery segments, users booking through a ride-hailing booking services company's websites or mobile applications make payment for booked goods or services by way of non-cash payment with a credit card, debit card or e-wallet (through intermediary payment service providers appointed by the e-commerce platform service providers) or in cash (through the goods delivery service provider as appointed by the e-commerce platform service providers). Under Decree No. 52/2024/ND-CP on non-cash payments ('Decree 52/2024'), the authorized collection service can be performed through a bank account (account-based cashless payment service) or a non-account-based cashless payment service. In addition to banks, people's credit funds and micro-finance institutions, certain non-banking entities may be approved by the State Bank of Vietnam, or the SBV, on a case-by-case basis, to provide account-based cashless payment services and non-account-based cashless payment services.

## Food Deliveries and Package Deliveries

Under the Law on Post No. 49/2010/QH12 and Decree No. 47/2011/ND-CP providing details for implementation of Law on Post, as amended in 2018 and 2022 ('Decree 47'), postal activities include activities, among others, (i) delivery of mails and paper documents, and (ii) delivery of goods parcel and package (such as GrabExpress). Vietnamese postal regulations require entities and individuals providing delivery or postal services (except, among others, individuals providing the services free of charge) to obtain a postal license or certificate on postal operation notification, depending on weight and type of items being delivered as well as territory in which the postal service provider operates. Failure to obtain the postal license or certificate on postal operation notification shall be subject to fines of up to VND 30 million (approximately $1,000), return of all profits earned from the activities without proper license or notification, and/or suspension or termination of the services.

Although the postal regulations require individual drivers to obtain a postal license or certificate on postal operation notification, Decree 47 is silent on the procedure for individual drivers to obtain such license and certificate. In the meantime, Circular 08 is the prevailing regulation governing delivery of goods by motorcycle (as section "Motorcycle Transport Service" above).

## Food Processing (including Food Packaging Service) and Trading (i.e., Food Wholesale and Retail)

Processing of food is mainly regulated by Law on Food Safety, Decree No. 15/2018/ND-CP (as amended in 2018 and 2019), which provides details for the implementation of Law on Food Safety, as last amended in 2019, and its guiding local documents. Food processing must be conducted with a Certificate of Eligibility of Food Hygiene and Safety Requirement (the 'Food Safety Certificate') issued by (i) the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development ('MARD') (now succeeded by the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment) or its subordinate agency (i.e., Department of Agriculture and Rural Development ('DARD'))(now succeeded by the Department of Agriculture and Environment) or (ii) MOIT or its subordinate agency DOIT, or Ho Chi Minh City's People's Committee and its designated agency Food Safety Department of Ho Chi Minh City, depending on the kind of food products and trade as well as scale of production. The term of Food Safety Certificate is three years and any renewal must be conducted at least six months prior to the expiry date. A company engaging in producing and trading food may be exempted from obtaining a Food Safety Certificate if such company has already obtained one of GMP, HACCP, ISO 22000, IFS, BRC, FESS 22000 or an equivalent certificate. We have obtained a Food Safety Certificate that is valid until April 7, 2025.

Failure to obtain a Food Safety Certificate shall lead to administrative fines of up to VND 40 million (approximately $2,000) for each location involved in producing and/or selling foods. In addition, food produced by the unlicensed establishment will be recalled and the company will be compelled to change the use purpose, or to recycle or dispose of the recalled foods.

## Financial Segment (including e-payment service and insurance business)

Intermediary payment services are mainly regulated by Law on Prevention of Money Laundering No. 14/2022/QH15, Decree 52/2024 and its guiding local documents. Under Decree 52/2024, intermediary payment services include, among others, e-wallet, e-payment gateway and other supporting payment services. Non-bank companies that wish to provide intermediary payment services are required to satisfy certain requirements, among others, having a minimum charter capital of VND 50 billion (approximately $2.1 million) and qualification and experience requirements for the service providers' managers, and then must obtain a license for intermediary payment services from the SBV ('IPS License'), which has a 10-year term. Changes in scope must be approved by the SBV prior to its effectiveness. Non-compliance with the above could potentially result in penalties including loss of, or restriction on, the license, compulsory return of illegitimate profits earned, and/or administration fines of up to VND 500 million (approximately $20,000) for each instance of noncompliance, imposed by the State Bank of Vietnam.

A company engaging in insurance agency service is required to satisfy certain requirements including, among others, execution of the insurance agency agreement with the insurer, and having, by July 1, 2024, at least three Vietnamese staff members residing in Vietnam from 18 years of age or above and holding an insurance agency certificate issued by an institution licensed by the Ministry of Finance. Non-compliance with the above may result in a fine of up to VND 80 million (approximately $3,000), and the insurance companies are required to cease using agents involved in violations within 12 months of receiving a penalty decision.

## Vietnamese Competition Law

Competition Law No. 23/2018/QH14 ('Competition Law') is envisaged to be primarily administered under the jurisdiction of the MOIT and the Viet Nam Competition Commission ('VCC'). The VCC was established on April 1, 2023, and its chairman has been appointed by the Prime Minister. The VCC oversees anti-competitive conduct, abuse of dominance, and merger control in Vietnam.

The Competition Law prohibits the following practices, among others: (i) anti-competitive agreements that restrict competition, such as pricefixing, market allocation, output restrictions, bid-rigging, hindering market entry, exclusion of non-parties, and imposing unrelated contractual conditions; (ii) abuse of dominant market position, such as predatory pricing, imposing unreasonable prices, restricting production or distribution, limiting market access, and applying discriminatory terms; (iii) abuse of monopoly, such as imposing unfavorable conditions on customers and unilaterally changing or terminating contracts without valid reason; and (iv) unfair competition, such as misleading advertising, defamation, and trade secret infringement. Penalties for noncompliance include fines of up to 10% of total revenue in the relevant market(s) during the preceding financial year for anti-competitive practices, and up to VND2 billion (approximately US$79,000) for unfair competition practices, confiscation of profits gained from illegal activities, and criminal sanctions depending on the severity of the violation.

The VCC also oversees merger control in Vietnam, i.e., any transaction considered to be an economic concentration that reaches certain reportable thresholds based on the size of transaction, total assets in Vietnam, total sales (or total purchase volume) in Vietnam, and market share, requires a notification of economic concentration and regulatory consent prior to signing of the transactional documents. For economic concentration implemented outside of Vietnamese territory, the thresholds taken into account are total assets in Vietnam, total sales or purchases generated in Vietnam and market share in Vietnam. The Competition Law provides a two-phase appraisal process of a merger filing: (i) preliminary appraisal and (ii) official appraisal. The preliminary appraisal phase may take up to 30 days from the filing date but may be prolonged. A transaction that does not qualify for any of the safe harbors in the preliminary appraisal will undergo the official appraisal phase which takes up to 90 - 150 days, which may be extended at the regulator's discretion. After the official appraisal phase, Vietnamese authorities may decide to conditionally allow, allow or prohibit the transaction.

Non-compliance with the notification to VCC before carrying out the execution of merger agreement under the transaction that is determined as an economic concentration may result in a fine from 1% to 5% of the total revenue in the relevant market(s) in the preceding financial year of each violating enterprise that is involved in the transaction. Similarly, the violations on anti-competitive agreements or abuse of dominance shall be subject to a fine amounting to 1% to 10% of the total revenue in the relevant(s) market in the preceding financial year. Based on the severity of the violations, the enterprises may also be subject to criminal liabilities, which include a monetary fine from VND 1 billion to VND 5 billion (approximately $39,000 to $196,000) or the involved business may be suspended for six months to two years; they might also be banned from operating in certain fields or raising capital for one to three years. Additionally, the person who commits the violations will also be subject to imprisonment for a term up to five years.

## Marketing Survey

Currently, under WTO Commitments and Vietnamese law, marketing survey is not subject to foreign ownership limitation and requirements to conduct this business line provided that marketing survey service does not cover the public opinion polling (CPC 86402), which has not yet been market approach.

## Vietnamese Law on Protection of Consumers' Rights and Personal Data Protection

The Law on Protection of Consumers' Rights 2023 No. 19/2023/QH15 imposes mandatory obligations on entities, particularly prominent technology corporations, engaged in targeted marketing data collection with significant bargaining power. Among other provisions, operators of large digital platforms, subject to government guidance yet to be issued, will face additional obligations. These include establishing an advertising storage system using algorithms to target consumers or specific groups, periodically evaluating content moderation activities, algorithmic system usage, and advertising targeting consumers or specific groups, as well as assessing the implementation of regulations on handling fake accounts and the use of artificial intelligence.

Vietnam issued the Law on Cyber Security and Decree No. 53/2022/ND-CP, which became effective on October 1, 2022, relating to cybersecurity, which provides guidelines on, among other requirements, implementing measures for cybersecurity protection and data localization. The competent authority has the right to either request for, or has access to any system that contains or commits violations against cybersecurity principles.

The Decree on Personal Data Protection (Decree No. 13/2023/ND-CP) ('PDPD') came into effect on July 1, 2023 and is considered to be a unified set of regulations on personal data protection. This Decree still requires broader implementation and there is expected to be a period of uncertainty until detailed guidance is provided. Generally, any person, or organization collecting or processing personal information is obligated to notify the data subjects on, among others, its purposes for processing such data, processing methods, unexpected consequences or damages that are likely to occur from the processing of their personal information, and specific timing for the data processing. Any collection, publication, processing, transfer to a third party, or any other use of a data subject's personal information requires prior consent of such data subject. Such consent must be clearly and specifically expressed, such as in writing, by voice, by ticking of a consent box, and must be verifiable. The data subject is entitled to access and directly update or modify its respective information. Unless such actions are restricted by law, upon request made by the data subject, respective information must be removed within 72 hours, and updates or modifications must be done as soon as possible. In cases where the data cannot be updated or modified, the data controller and processor must notify the data subject within 72 hours of receipt. Impact assessments must be performed for all processing activities, as well as cross border transfers. The upcoming Law on Personal Data Protection (PDPL) has more stringent provisions than the Personal Data Protection Decree, which will apply to us.

The Law on Data, which is set become effective on July 1, 2025, establishes a legal framework for managing, processing, protecting, and utilizing digital data in Vietnam. It applies to both Vietnamese and foreign entities handling data within Vietnam and governs digital data at the national, organizational, and individual levels. The law categorizes data into types such as shared data, private data, open data, core data, and important data, and sets principles for data collection, storage, processing, and sharing. Key authorities, such as the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Defense, are tasked with overseeing data governance and security. The Law on Data aims to foster a balanced approach, supporting economic growth while safeguarding national interests and individual rights. Below are key notes regarding data trading and transfer, data sharing, and data platforms under the Law on Data.

- · Data trading and transfer: The law sets conditions for cross-border data transfers, prioritizing national security and legal compliance. It distinguishes between general and critical data, with stricter controls on the latter. Specifically, general data can be freely transferred across borders if legal compliance is ensured, while critical data (e.g., core or important data) requires government approval and must meet specific conditions. Additionally, transfers must safeguard national interests, privacy, and security.

## Table of Contents

- · Data sharing: the law establishes a framework for sharing data between entities while ensuring regulatory compliance. The data owners and controllers must enable lawful access and sharing. Data owners and controllers are required to identify and mitigate risks, address incidents promptly, and notify affected parties. Additionally, owners and controllers of core and important data must conduct regular risk assessments and report findings to cybersecurity authorities.
- · Data platforms: Data platforms act as intermediaries facilitating data exchange for research, innovation, and economic development. Platforms must register, comply with government oversight, and prevent activities that threaten national security or privacy. Data service providers must ensure data integrity, security, and transparency, and must also monitor for breaches or unauthorized use.
- · State access to data: Authorities can request data from organizations or individuals under specific conditions, such as emergencies or national security threats. Entities must comply with these requests without requiring prior consent from data subjects in certain cases.

Failure to comply with prevailing data protection provisions may lead to a fine of up to VND70 million (approximately $3,000) according to Decree No. 15/2020/ND-CP, as amended in 2022. Under the Criminal Code No. 100/2015/QH13, as amended in 2017, serious violation of personal information may lead to criminal proceedings, including a fine of up to VND 1 billion (approximately $39,000) or imprisonment for a term up to seven years. The offender may also be prohibited from taking on certain roles for a term up to five years.

## Regulations on Anti-money Laundering and Prevention of Terrorism Financing

Vietnam's Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering contains anti-money laundering and prevention of terrorism financing regulations and applies to all financial institutions and certain non-financial institutions engaged in specific business activities, which include payment services. The Department of Anti-Money Laundering established under the SBV monitors and regulates Vietnam's anti-money laundering regime. Entities subject to the antimoney laundering regime must report certain transactions to the Department of Anti-Money Laundering, including high-value transactions, suspicious transactions, and transactions involving companies or individuals in the countries and territories on the 'black list' published by the Ministry of Public Security. Moreover, apart from the know-your-client procedures required by Vietnamese law, entities subject to the anti-money laundering regime must perform an enhanced due diligence investigation on high-risk parties, which include foreign individuals on the list of 'politically influenced persons' published by the SBV, or individuals or entities conducting transactions using new technologies (i.e., technology enabling such individuals or entities to conduct transactions without meeting in person with a member or staff of the bank). Non-compliance with the law on the prevention of money laundering may subject the company to administrative fines of up to VND 1 billion (approximately $39,000), and to remedial measures of suspension or dismissal from management, executive, or controlling positions, or criminal sanctions according to the severity of the violation.

## Regulations on Electronic Transactions

The National Assembly of Vietnam approved the new Law on E-Transactions ('LET 2024'), which took effect on July 1, 2024. This legislative update is a significant step by the Vietnamese government to implement appropriate regulations for digital services and transactions. Among other things, the LET 2024 provides that the administrators of information systems, including digital platforms like Grab, adhere to specific regulations. These regulations entail (i) furnishing information through electronic means in compliance with the law to support the statistical work, inspection and reporting upon request of the state management agency concerning electronic transactions; and (ii) sharing data to serve state management regarding electronic transactions.

Decree No. 137/2024/ND-CP ('Decree 137'), which became effective on October 23, 2024, sets out regulations for large-scale and very largescale intermediary digital platforms that facilitate electronic transactions or service development while maintaining independence from the parties involved in these transactions. The decree classifies intermediary digital platforms serving electronic transactions into two categories based on their monthly average user base:

- · Large-scale platforms: Platforms with monthly users comprising 3%-10% of Vietnam's total population.
- · Very large-scale platforms: Platforms with monthly users exceeding 10% of Vietnam's total population.

## Table of Contents

Under Decree 137, intermediary digital platform operators are required to determine their user scale by October 23, 2025. If they meet the criteria for large-scale or very large-scale platforms, they must report the relevant statistics to the Ministry of Information and Communications. Operators are then required to reassess their user scale annually by January 31 and continue to comply with reporting obligations.

The decree outlines several obligations for platform owners/operators: (i) providing user volume statistics and operational data to regulatory authorities; and (ii) establishing mechanisms to address user complaints, disputes, and violations of the law. For very large-scale platforms, additional obligations include: (i) publicly disclosing the criteria used for content or advertisement recommendations and providing users with the option to opt out of these features; (ii) allowing users to uninstall pre-installed applications without disrupting system functionality; and (iii) publicly sharing and promoting a code of conduct to ensure a fair, safe, and respectful environment for all users.

## C. Organizational Structure

We are a limited liability company incorporated in the Cayman Islands that is a holding company and does not have substantive operations. We conduct our businesses through our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities and may also own minority interests in certain businesses. The laws and regulations in certain markets in which we operate, including Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia place restrictions on foreign investment in and ownership of entities engaged in a number of business activities. As a result, in Thailand and with respect to certain businesses in Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, we conduct our business through consolidated affiliated entities in which in addition to our ownership of equity interests, some of which may be minority interests, we have certain rights pursuant to contractual arrangements with other shareholders of the relevant entities that allow us to consolidate the results of such entities under IFRS.

In addition to directly or indirectly holding equity interests in such consolidated affiliated entities, we have entered into certain contractual arrangements, which provide us with control over the relevant entities. The contractual arrangements with respect to our principal consolidated affiliated entities consist of the following:

- · In Thailand, we exercise control over relevant Thai operating entities as a result of a dual-class share and two-tiered corporate structure. We own ordinary shares in the top level holding company, Thai Holding Entity 2, that gives us control of Thai Holding Entity 2 based on shareholder meeting quorum and voting requirements. Our Thai local partner, Mr. Vee Charununsiri ('Thai local partner'), holds preference shares in Thai Holding Entity 2 that have limited rights to liquidation proceeds upon liquidation of the company. Such arrangements are reflected in the Articles of Association of Thai Holding Entity 2. In addition to the Articles of Association, which provide us with our control over Thai Holding Entity 2, pursuant to a Call Option Agreement between us and our Thai local partner, we also have the right to acquire the Thai local partner's shares in Thai Holding Entity 2 upon the occurrence of certain events.
- · In Indonesia, powers of attorney granted by PT Ekanusa Yadhikarya Indah and PT Ekanusa Yudhakarya Indah (both of which are controlled by our Indonesian local partner, Mr. Leo Mahamit) with respect to PT Solusi Pengiriman Indonesia provide us control over those two Indonesian operating entities. PT Ekanusa Yadhikarya Indah and PT Ekanusa Yudhakarya Indah agree thereunder to hold their shares in trust for our benefit and to exercise their voting rights as instructed by us. With respect to BCP, pursuant to a shareholders agreement entered into with PT Cakra Finansindo Investama (which is controlled by our Indonesian local partner, Mr. Arsjad Rasjid) and PT Abhimata Anugrah Abadi (which is controlled by our local partner, Mr. Alvin Sariaatmadja), we have certain contractual rights, which include rights to (a) control the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer (including the right to nominate any such officers as directors or as president director), (b) approve the budget and business plan of BCP and its subsidiaries; and (c) approve future funding of BCP and its subsidiaries, whether through debt, equity or otherwise. In each case, in addition to the aforementioned contractual rights, we also have a call option that provides us the right to require the aforementioned local partners to transfer their shares in the aforementioned entities to another party and the local partners' shares in such entities are also pledged, which means the local partners can transfer their shares only upon receiving our consent.

## Table of Contents

•

- In Vietnam, we exercise control over relevant Vietnam operating entities based on voting thresholds set forth in Grab Company Limited, the Vietnam holding company's charter, pursuant to which resolutions are passed by way of written resolutions agreed by members holding at least 75% of the company's share capital or votes at a physical meeting where members holding at least 75% of the company's share capital vote in favor of the resolution. Since we hold 49% of the share capital of the Vietnam holding company, our affirmative vote is required for passage of any resolution of the Vietnam holding company. In addition, pursuant to a Members' Agreement entered into by us with our Vietnamese local partner, Ms. Ly Thuy Bich Huyen ('Vietnamese local partner'), to the extent permitted by local law, certain reserved matters, including important matters that relate to businesses and operations of Grab Vietnam are subject to our consent. In addition to the aforementioned charter and Members' Agreement which provide us with control over our Vietnam operating entities, we also have a call option that provides us with the right to acquire the Vietnamese local partner's shares in the Vietnam holding company, and this right is secured by a security arrangement over the Vietnamese local partner's shares. The Vietnamese local partner's shares in the Vietnam holding company are pledged, which prevents the Vietnamese local partner from disposing of her shares without our consent.

•

- In the Philippines, we exercise control over relevant Philippine operating entities pursuant to an Investment Agreement between us and our Philippine local partner, Mr. Jesse Stefan H. Maxwell, relating to Grab PH Holdings Inc. that gives us (a) the right to (i) appoint directors in proportion to our shareholding interest, (ii) exercise veto rights with respect to certain reserved matters that fundamentally affect the business of the company, (iii) receive the economic benefits and absorb losses of the Philippine entities in proportion to the amount and value of our investment, and (b) an exclusive call option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in certain circumstances. In addition, the above-mentioned control-related rights under the Investment Agreement have been included in the Amended Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of Grab PH Holdings Inc. The Amended Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws have been approved by the Philippines SEC, the relevant terms of the Investment Agreement are memorialized in the Amended Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws which are public records that are binding not only on Grab PH Holdings Inc. and the shareholders but also on third parties in relation to the matters covered thereby. A breach of the Investment Agreement (including in respect of the above-mentioned control rights) would give rise to the right to bring a claim for breach of contract thereunder. Additionally, any action that contravenes the Amended Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws would be invalid and unenforceable and thereby be incrementally beneficial to the party seeking to enforce its terms.
- · In Malaysia, we own 50% of the voting shares in Jaya Grocer outright. The balance of the voting shares are owned by our Malaysian local partner, Green Aurora Sdn Bhd ('Malaysian local partner'), an entity owned by one of our employees. Pursuant to a management agreement entered into by us through our wholly owned subsidiary, Jaya Grocer and the Malaysian local partner, to the extent permitted by local law, we generally have the ability or right to decide, among others, on business and financial strategies, including funding, and other strategy matters in relation to the business of Jaya Grocer, in the best interest of Jaya Grocer and in consultation with the Malaysian local partner. We also have a call option that provides us with the right, to the extent permitted by local law, to acquire the Jaya Grocer shares held by the Malaysian local partner and also a power of attorney that provides us with the right to direct the transfer of the shares of the Malaysian local partner (and therefore, indirectly, its shares in Jaya Grocer), to the extent permitted by local law, in the event of a default under the subscription agreement of the preference shares with the Malaysian local partner.

Such arrangements involve risks that are greater than those involved in holding a direct equity interest, including, among others, risks related to regulatory actions or disputes with the aforementioned local partners, which could, among other things, adversely impact our operations in the relevant jurisdictions and our consolidation of the financial conditions and results of operations of such entities in our consolidated financial statements, cause us to incur substantial costs in protecting our rights or result in our inability to enforce our rights. For a discussion of the foregoing restrictions and certain risks related thereto, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - Regulatory Environment' and 'Item 3.

| (3)   | Thailand: Our deliveries, mobility and financial services businesses are each conducted through a Thai operating entity (including, in the case of mobility and deliveries, Grabtaxi (Thailand) Co., Ltd.) established using a tiered shareholding structure, so that each Thai entity (including Grabtaxi Holdings (Thailand) Co., Ltd.) is more than 50% owned by a Thai person or entity. This tiered shareholding structure, together with certain rights attendant to the classes of shares we hold and as otherwise set forth in the organizational documents of the relevant entities within our shareholding structure in Thailand, enables us to control these Thai operating entities and consolidate their financial results in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| (4)   | Philippines: Our four wheel-mobility and delivery businesses are each conducted through a Philippine operating entity (including, in the case of our four wheel-mobility business, MyTaxi.PH, Inc.), the shares of which are 40% owned by us, with the balance owned by a Philippine holding company. The shares of the Philippine holding company are 40% legal and/or beneficially owned by us, with the balance 60% of the shares held by an entity owned by a Philippine national who is a director of certain of our Philippine operating entities, including MyTaxi.PH, Inc. Through contractual rights with the Philippine shareholder together with certain other rights, we are able to consolidate the financial results of our Philippine operating entities in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The non-controlling interest of the Philippine shareholder is accounted for in our consolidated financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## A. Operating Results

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in 'Item 3. Key Information-D. Risk Factors' and the section titled 'Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,' which you should review for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this annual report.

## Key Factors Affecting Our Performance

## Our ability to grow and engage platform consumers

The number of platform consumers, which we measure by MTUs, is a key driver of the activity on our platform and the scale of our business. More consumers accessing offerings on our platform not only drives increased revenue, but contributes to powerful synergies that accelerate with scale. We expect platform consumers to grow as the value offered to them on our platform increases through product innovation, improved user experience, and more offerings. Building on our brand and market position across online food delivery, mobility and e-wallet payments, we expect platform consumers to grow organically. We also intend to continue to use promotions to attract consumers to our platform base and to engage MTUs. Our GrabUnlimited subscription, GrabRewards, Jaya Grocer loyalty program and OVO rewards loyalty programs are important components of our consumer retention strategy, encouraging consumers to continue transacting on our platform. Our digital banking services in Singapore and Malaysia through GXS Bank and GXBank, which we publicly launched in 2022 and 2023, respectively, enables us to improve financial inclusion in these countries.

We believe platform consumers will increase their usage and spending on services offered through our platform as they discover additional features and offerings, and as they choose to incorporate them more deeply into their daily lives. In addition, we expect usage and spending across user cohorts to increase as we grow our platform, benefiting our driver- and merchant-partners.

## Our ability to grow driver- and merchant-partners and scope of our offerings

Our growing base of merchant-partners provides opportunities to drive revenue growth, and our expanding base of driver-partners allows us to benefit from significant cost synergies and economies of scale as we deploy resources more efficiently. Our ability to maintain and grow our merchant-partner base depends in part on our ability to continue to solve mission-critical challenges for our merchant-partners. We therefore continue to invest in our merchantcentric initiatives to enable more small businesses to thrive on our platform. We also plan to continue investing in strengthening our sales force. We have also invested substantially in our technology platform to provide our merchant-partners with the tools they need to thrive in the digital economy.

Additionally, maintaining and continuing to grow our base of driver-partners is critical to delivering a quality experience on our platform. The more driver-partners that we have on our platform, the more deliveries and rides our driver-partners are able to provide, while maintaining high quality service and low wait times. Our driver-partner loyalty program provides our most engaged driver-partners with a variety of benefits, and we have encouraged our driver-partners to participate in training programs. Finally, we actively listen to our driver-partners' concerns and feedback. Driver-partners' representative committees gather and provide insights on how Grab can further enhance their experience.

We have also created the GrabForGood Fund, an endowment fund that supports programs that promote longer term socioeconomic mobility and improvement of quality of life of our driver- and merchant-partners, as well as that of the broader Southeast Asia community. This includes three core focuses on education, partner community care and climate disaster relief. In 2024, we extended the GrabScholar programme to Malaysia, in addition to Indonesia and the Philippines. Through this program, the GrabForGood Fund supports 1,700 school-going children and 27 undergraduate scholars annually, most of whom are our driver-partners or their direct family members.

## Table of Contents

We believe that increasing the depth and breadth of our offerings will attract more consumers to our platform and in turn more driver- and merchant-partners to our platform. We intend to enhance our value proposition to driver- and merchant-partners by continuing to evolve the scope of our offerings, increasing the size and engagement of the consumer base to drive greater demand, developing innovative marketing services, and improving the analytics tools available to our partners.

## Our ability to realize operating leverage on our platform

Since our founding, we have established numerous touch points with consumers, which allows us to facilitate a broad range of additional services through our platform. We believe we can leverage our platform and ecosystem to roll out new offerings rapidly and efficiently. For example, we launched our GrabUnlimited offerings across our six core markets by the end of 2022. Increasing the depth and breadth of offerings on our platform drives the attractiveness of our platform for merchant-partners and consumers.

We foster an ecosystem in which participants engage with each other through our platform. Consumers purchase goods and services from driverand merchant-partners, and driver- and merchant-partners interact with each other to fulfill delivery orders. Driver- and merchant-partners also purchase financial services directly through our platform and transact across verticals, which underpins the strength of our competitive advantage.

During the initial stages of growth, we offered significant incentives and promotions to attract platform consumers as well as incentives to attract driver- and merchant-partners, and conducted advertising activities to enhance our brand awareness. We continue to leverage incentives and advertising to promote our platform and offerings.

## Our ability to invest effectively in technology and research and development

We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in research and development and technology to improve our platform to attract and retain driver- and merchant-partners, and consumers, expand the capabilities and scope of our offerings, and enhance the consumer experience.

Our engineers and data scientists are critical to the success of our business and we will continue to invest in the best talent in these areas. In addition, we have dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to research and development efforts, focusing on developing innovative applications and offerings aimed at fulfilling the everyday needs of consumers by enabling merchant-partners to improve their service quality and operational efficiency, as well as advancing our big data and AI capabilities. We use AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants to handle customer inquiries, freeing up our human agents to manage more complex issues to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Our ability to enter into strategic partnerships, investments, and acquisitions

Since our founding, we have made a number of critical strategic investments and acquisitions and entered into partnerships to enhance our platform and attract consumers. The most strategic of these was our acquisition of Uber's Southeast Asia operations in 2018. In 2021, we also entered into a strategic partnership with PT Elang Mahkota Teknologi, an Indonesia group with a portfolio of media, all-commerce and content production businesses. In 2022, we completed the acquisition of a majority economic interest in Jaya Grocer in Malaysia, and entered into a strategic partnership and investment in PT Trans Retail, a hypermarket chain in Indonesia, to complement our business. In 2022 and 2023, GXS Bank and GXBank have been publicly launched in Singapore and Malaysia, respectively, and are continuing to build their customer base and expand their product offerings. In 2024, PT Super Bank Indonesia, in which we have a 30.84% equity interest, was publicly launched as a digital bank in Indonesia, and we acquired Nham24, a food delivery platform in Cambodia, and Chope, a restaurant reservation platform in certain parts of Southeast Asia. In March 2025, we acquired a majority interest in Everrise, a premium supermarket chain that operates predominately in East Malaysia.

We expect to continue to enter into strategic partnerships, investments, and acquisitions that we believe will expand or enhance the offerings on our platform and attract more merchants and consumers to our platform. We have already acquired an extensive suite of financial services licenses, including payments licenses in six core regional markets, and are in the process of building Singapore's next-generation digital bank in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia through joint ventures and collaborations with our local partners.

## Our ability to moderate the use of driver- and merchant-partner and consumer incentives

We offer various incentives to our driver- and merchant-partners that are deducted from the fees received from driver- or merchant-partners (typically being a percentage of the fare paid by the consumer to the driver- or merchant-partner or a service fee that varies). We also offer consumer incentives that reduce the amount payable by a consumer to driver- or merchant-partners. In addition, incentives for consumers offered and paid for by our merchantpartners drives demand on our platform and to the extent that these are effective in doing so we may be able to reduce the portion of overall incentives paid by us. Conversely, to the extent that merchant-partners are less willing to provide such incentives, we may need to increase our incentives to keep our platform attractive. The incentives that we offer to driver- and merchant-partners and consumers for a transaction may sometimes exceed our fees and commissions from a particular transaction, and may in aggregate sometimes exceed our aggregate fees and commissions in a particular reporting period.

Our revenues are generally reported net of partner and consumer incentives, so if incentives exceed our commissions and fees received, it can result in us reporting negative revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we incurred incentives presented in the table below, resulting in reductions to our reported revenues of the same amounts. Under the principal model which is adopted for certain delivery offerings in certain of our markets, delivery fees paid by users in that market are recognized as revenue to us, and the amount paid to driver-partners, including driver-partner incentives are recognized as a cost of revenue, and are excluded from the incentives presented in the below table.

| (in $ millions, unless otherwise stated)   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
|                                            | 2024                      | 2023                      | 2022                      |
| Partner incentives                         | 755                       | 682                       | 801                       |
| Consumer incentives                        | 1,088                     | 907                       | 1,169                     |
| Total partner and consumer incentives      | 1,843                     | 1,589                     | 1,970                     |

With significant incentive payments to encourage the use of our platform, our MTUs increased to 41.3 million in 2024, from 35.5 million and 32.7 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.

As our platform grows, we have been able to take advantage of the synergies of our platform and strategic use of incentives to encourage the use of our platform and acquire driver- and merchant-partners on to our platform over time, leading to an increase in on-demand revenue as a percentage of ondemand GMV in 2024, 2023 and 2022. However, from time to time we may also increase incentives due to competitive factors in a particular country or area. In 2022, incentives accounted for $1.9 billion (13.3% of on-demand GMV) across mobility and deliveries segments whereas in 2023 and 2024, incentives accounted for $1.6 billion (9.9% of on-demand GMV) and $1.8 billion (10.0% of on-demand GMV), respectively, across mobility and deliveries segments.

We expect that our ability to successfully moderate the use of incentives paid to driver- and merchant-partners and consumers over time relative to the commissions and fees we receive will likely impact our ability to increase revenues, raise capital, reduce net losses, achieve profitability and reduce net cash outflow. Future decreases in the use of incentives could result in decreased growth in the number of users and driver- and merchant-partners or an overall decrease in users and driver- and merchant-partners, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.

## The impact of government policies and regulations in the markets in which we operate

We operate across the deliveries, mobility and financial services segments in Southeast Asia. Each of our businesses is subject to government regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate. Regulations have impacted or could impact, among others, the nature of and scope of offerings we are able to make available through our platform, the pricing of offerings on our platform, our relationship with, and incentives, fees and commissions provided to or charged from, driver- and merchant-partners, incentives provided to consumers, our ability to operate in certain segments of our business, our ownership percentage in operating entities that may be subject to foreign ownership restrictions, benefits, welfare and protection we are required to provide to our driverpartners, and insurance we are required to maintain. We expect that our ability to manage our relationships with regulators in each of our markets, as well as existing and evolving regulations will continue to impact our results in the future.

## Segment Reporting Changes

Beginning from January 1, 2024, we report our segment results as deliveries, mobility, financial services, and others:

- · Deliveries primarily includes on-demand and scheduled delivery of daily necessities including ready-to-eat meals and groceries, as well as point-to-point package delivery. It also includes offline sales from Jaya Grocer and advertising contributions.
- · Mobility primarily includes rides provided by driver-partners across a wide variety of multi-modal mobility options including private cars, taxis, motorcycles, and shared mobility options such as carpooling. It also includes vehicle rentals for our driver-partners and advertising contributions.
- · Financial services primarily includes digital payments, lending, insurance distribution, digital banking services in Singapore and Malaysia, and advertising contributions.
- · Others is a combination of multiple operating businesses that are not individually material.

These reporting changes were made to align with changes in how we manage and evaluate the performance of our business.

As part of the segment reporting changes, we have discontinued the reporting of GMV for our financial services segment, consistent with our strategic focus on ecosystem transactions and lending activities, and we limit our GMV reporting to our on-demand businesses. Additionally, advertising contributions previously reported within the enterprise and new initiatives segment are now reported in the respective mobility, deliveries and financial services segments in accordance with the relevant advertising products. Other reporting changes made include a portion of payment transaction revenues and transaction costs (which we refer to as the net cost of funds) and other relevant support costs previously reported in our financial services segment that relate to mobility and deliveries transactions now being allocated to the respective mobility and deliveries segments. Selected regional corporate costs that support our mobility, deliveries and financial services segments are now also allocated to these respective segments. After the aforementioned reporting updates are made, our four reporting segments include: deliveries, mobility, financial services, and others.

In conjunction with these reporting changes, certain prior year amounts shown in this annual report have been recast to conform to the new segment reporting structure for the purposes of comparison. These reporting changes have no impact on previously reported consolidated statements of financial position, statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity or statement of cash flows.

## Components of Results of Operations

## Revenue

We primarily generate revenue from commissions and fees for our deliveries, mobility and financial services offerings. Revenue is presented net of driver-partner, merchant-partner and consumer incentives, which could result in negative revenue where these amounts exceed our commissions and fees.

Deliveries revenue was $1,493 million in 2024 compared to $1,310 million in 2023. The increase in revenue for deliveries was primarily driven by (i) an increase in deliveries GMV of 13%, or $1.4 billion, to $11.7 billion in 2024 compared to $10.4 billion in 2023, due to increased consumer demand and platform engagement with technology-led product innovations; (ii) an increase of $70 million in contributions from Jaya Grocer; and (iii) an increase of $57 million in contributions from advertising. Deliveries revenue as a percentage of deliveries GMV remained consistent at 13% in 2024 and 2023. Our partner incentives were $482 million and $448 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our consumer incentives were $829 million and $712 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The increase in revenue was primarily driven by stronger demand and platform engagement with our product initiatives, with mobility GMV increasing to $6.6 billion in 2024 from $5.4 billion in 2023, while mobility revenue as a percentage of mobility GMV remained consistent at 16% in 2024 and 2023. Our incentives increased by $107 million (comprised of an increase of $39 million in partner incentives and $68 million in consumer incentives) to $517 million (comprised of $273 million in partner incentives and $244 million in consumer incentives) in 2024 from $410 million (comprised of $234 million in partner incentives and $176 million in consumer incentives) in 2023.

Financial services revenue increased to $253 million in 2024 from to $177 million in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $41 million growth in our lending businesses through our ecosystem partners and users, and a $29 million growth in our digital banking and payment businesses.

## Table of Contents

Cost of revenue increased by $124 million, or 8%, to $1,623 million in 2024 from $1,499 million in 2023, primarily due to a $54 million increase in cost of food and mart supplies due to the addition of new Jaya Grocer stores, a $23 million increase in payment processing fees and cost of funds due to an increase in the volume of transactions, a $17 million increase in interest expense for digital banking customers due to a higher amount of deposits, a $15 million increase in drivers acquisition, payout and retention costs and a $9 million increase in ride cover and car insurance costs. These increases were partially offset by a $4 million decrease in staff compensation costs and a $4 million decrease in infrastructure and cloud-hosting costs, driven by our cost reduction efforts in these areas. As a result of our efforts to drive cost efficiency, we become more efficient in supporting platform users and partners over time and our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased from 64% in 2023 to 58% in 2024.

* Amount less than $1 million

Net finance income increased by $21 million, or 35%, to $81 million in 2024 from $60 million in 2023. The increase in net finance income was primarily due to a $64 million decrease in interest costs due to the settlement of our term loan, $39 million decrease in unfavorable fair value adjustments for certain investments, partially offset by a $72 million increase in net foreign exchange losses and a $10 million decrease in interest income.

Our revenue increased by $926 million, to $2,359 million in 2023 from $1,433 million in 2022.

Revenue is presented net of partner and consumer incentives. Partner incentives were $682 million and $801 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, and consumer incentives were $907 million and $1,169 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.

## Table of Contents

Deliveries revenue was $1,310 million in 2023 compared to revenue of $724 million in 2022. The increase in revenue for deliveries was primarily driven by our disciplined approach to reducing incentives by $405 million as we focused on driving higher quality GMV transactions, and a change in business model of certain deliveries offerings in one of our markets which changed the revenue accounting from an agent to a principal based model and increased our revenue by $183 million in 2023. Deliveries revenue as a percentage of deliveries GMV improved from 7% in 2022 to 13% in 2023, as we gained network efficiency in our driver-partner base, and were able to improve our overall value proposition in terms of merchant selection, delivery performance and application experience on our superapp platform. Our partner incentives were $448 million and $599 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our consumer incentives were $712 million and $966 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Deliveries GMV increased to $10.4 billion in 2023 compared to $10.0 billion in 2022.

Mobility revenue increased by $229 million, to $871 million in 2023 compared to $643 million in 2022, which was primarily due to ride hailing revenue increasing by $210 million and rental income from motor vehicles increasing by $20 million. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by the strong demand recovery following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in 2022 and 2023 across Southeast Asia with a growth in domestic demand and recovery in tourism ride-hailing demand. Our incentives increased by $93 million (comprised of an increase of $32 million in partner incentives and $62 million in consumer incentives) to $410 million (comprised of $234 million in partner incentives and $176 million in consumer incentives) in 2023 compared to $317 million (comprised of $202 million in partner incentives and $115 million in consumer incentives) in 2022. Mobility GMV increased to $5.4 billion in 2023 compared to $4.1 billion in 2022, while mobility revenue as a percentage of mobility GMV remained consistent at 16% in 2022 and 2023.

Financial services revenue improved to $177 million in 2023, compared to $64 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to a $87 million growth in our digital banking business and payment business, and a $15 million growth in our lending businesses.

Others revenue decreased by $1 million to $1 million in 2023 compared to $2 million in 2022.

Cost of revenue increased by $144 million, or 11%, to $1,499 million in 2023 from $1,356 million in 2022, primarily due to a $176 million increase in cost of revenue as a result of the change in business model for delivery offerings in one of our markets, which changed our accounting from an agent to principal based model, and a $39 million increase in cost of food and mart supplies. These increases were partially offset by a $43 million decrease in staff compensation costs and a $34 million decrease in cost of funds, infrastructure and cloud-hosting costs, driven by our cost reduction efforts in these areas. As a result of our efforts to drive cost efficiency, we become more efficient in supporting platform users and partners over time and our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased from 95% to 64%.

## Key Non-IFRS Financial Measures

In addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key non-IFRS financial measures to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. However, the definitions of our non-IFRS financial measures may be different from those used by other companies, and therefore, may not be comparable. Furthermore, these non-IFRS financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses reflected in our consolidated financial statements that are necessary to run our business. Thus, these non-IFRS financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.

We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of these non-IFRS financial measures to the related IFRS financial measures under the section titled '-Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Financial Measures.' We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view these non-IFRS financial measures in conjunction with their respective related IFRS financial measures.

## Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA

Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure representing the sum of Segment Adjusted EBITDA of our four business segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure, representing the Adjusted EBITDA of each of our four business segments, excluding, in each case, regional corporate costs. Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA also reflect any applicable exclusions from Adjusted EBITDA. See 'Adjusted EBITDA' below.

Regional corporate costs are costs that are not attributed to any of the business segments, including certain costs of revenue, regional research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses and marketing expenses. These regional costs of revenue include cloud computing costs. These regional research and development expenses also include costs related to mapping and payment technologies and support and development of the internal technology infrastructure. These general and administrative expenses also include certain shared costs such as finance, accounting, tax, human resources, technology and legal costs. Regional corporate costs exclude share-based compensation expenses and capitalized software costs. Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a useful indicator of the economics of our segments, as it does not include regional corporate costs. Our regional corporate costs decreased to $350 million in 2024 from $398 million in 2023 and $422 million in 2022. We expect our regional corporate costs to increase in 2025 due to platform investments and increased costs due to transaction growth.

## Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure calculated as profit (loss) for the period adjusted to exclude: (i) net finance income (costs), including interest income (expenses), foreign exchange gain (loss) and changes in fair value of financial assets and liabilities, (ii) net other income (expenses), (iii) income tax expenses (credit), (iv) depreciation and amortization, (v) share-based compensation expenses, (vi) costs related to mergers and acquisitions, (vii) impairment losses on goodwill and non-financial assets, (viii) restructuring costs, (ix) legal, tax and regulatory settlement provisions and (x) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Starting from January 1, 2024, realized foreign exchange gain (loss) is additionally excluded from Adjusted EBITDA (as compared to only unrealized foreign exchange gain (loss) in previous reports). We believe that this change enhances the comparison of our company with certain of our peers. Adjusted EBITDA for all periods presented in this annual report reflect this new definition of Adjusted EBITDA.

## Legal, tax and regulatory settlement provisions

Legal, tax and regulatory settlement provisions are primarily related to certain significant legal proceedings, tax and regulatory settlements that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis. These matters often span extended time periods, and are unpredictable in timing and magnitude. Accordingly, they are distinct from routine legal, tax and regulatory expenses incurred in our normal course of operations.

## Adjusted Free Cash Flow

Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a non-IFRS financial measure, defined as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures (including assets acquired under lease arrangements), excluding changes in working capital related to loans and advances to customers, and deposits from the digital banking business. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a metric we use to monitor business performance and assess cash flow activity, other than lending and digital banking deposit activities. We believe this metric is a useful indicator for comparison with the cash flow reporting of certain of our peers.

Our deliveries segment had a 14% increase in revenue of $183 million from $1.3 billion in 2023 to $1.5 billion in 2024. The strong growth was primarily due to increasing consumer demand, an increase of $70 million in contributions from Jaya Grocer, and an increase of $57 million in contributions from advertising. Additionally, Segment Adjusted EBITDA improved to $196 million in 2024 from $81 million in 2023. This was primarily attributable to a revenue growth of $183 million in the deliveries segment, partially offset by an increase of $25 million in marketing costs for this segment. The revenue growth was also due to the further adoption of key affordability and high value product initiatives, as well as newer features such as Group Orders and Dine Out, as we expand our product offerings and increase platform engagement.

Our mobility segment grew in 2024 from 2023, driven primarily by strong demand across key markets and our expansion into more affordable mobility options. We continued to increase active driver supply and enhance the productivity of our driver-partners to meet growing demand levels. Monthly active driver supply has surpassed pre-COVID supply levels. Our revenue increased by 20% to $1.0 billion in 2024 from $871 million in 2023, signaling demand growth and underlining strong unit economics fundamentals in our mobility segment. Additionally, Segment Adjusted EBITDA improved to $569 million in 2024 from $466 million in 2023. This was primarily attributable to the revenue growth of $175 million in the mobility segment, partially offset by an increase of $17 million in marketing costs for this segment.

Our financial services segment grew significantly in 2024 as compared to 2023 as we rolled out more new offerings. Our revenue for this segment increased from $177 million in 2023 to $253 million in 2024. The strong growth was primarily attributed to a $41 million increase from our lending businesses, and a $29 million increase from our digital banking and payment businesses. Additionally, Segment Adjusted EBITDA improved to $(105) million in 2024 from $(170) million in 2023, attributable to the revenue growth of $77 million in the financial services segment, along with reductions in overhead expenses of $24 million for this segment as we continued to optimize costs. These were partially offset by an increase in costs of $35 million for this segment as we continued to ramp our recently launched and expanded digital banking business.

## On-Demand Gross Merchandise Value

On-demand GMV is a metric by which we understand, evaluate and manage our business, and we believe is necessary for investors to understand and evaluate our business. On-demand GMV refers to the sum of GMV of the mobility and deliveries segments. As part of the segment reporting changes beginning on January 1, 2024, we have discontinued the reporting of GMV for our financial services segment, consistent with our strategic focus on ecosystem transactions and lending activities, and we limit our GMV reporting to our on-demand businesses. GMV provides useful information to investors as it represents the amount of a customer's spending that is being directed through our platform. We present GMV as a metric to understand and compare, and to enable investors to understand and compare our aggregate operating results, which captures significant trends in our business over time.

We achieved overall growth in on-demand GMV of 16% from $15.8 billion in 2023 to $18.4 billion in 2024. Deliveries GMV increased 13% to $11.7 billion in 2024 from $10.4 billion in 2023. Mobility GMV increased 23% to $6.6 billion in 2024 from $5.4 billion in 2023. We believe that we have a strong opportunity to continue growing on-demand GMV due to the extent of the market opportunity and initiatives to re-accelerate growth, along with our platform advantages.

The table below sets forth on-demand GMV, deliveries GMV and mobility GMV for the periods indicated.

## Monthly Transacting Users

MTU is a metric by which we understand, evaluate and manage our business, and we believe is necessary for investors to understand and evaluate our business. Overall Group MTUs increased by 5.8 million, or 16%, to 41.3 million in 2024 from 35.5 million in 2023. The increase in on-demand MTUs signaled demand growth as evidenced by an increase in deliveries and mobility MTUs. Financial services MTUs grew due to deeper on-platform penetration driven by growth in deliveries and mobility MTUs, and our digital banking business.

The table below sets forth MTUs by segment for the periods indicated.

The revenue growth for our deliveries segment in 2024 was primarily driven by GMV growth from our food deliveries business, as well as growing contributions from Jaya Grocer and advertising business. Our food deliveries business GMV increased by $836 million, or 11%, while Jaya Grocer GMV increased by $74 million, or 18%, and advertising business GMV increased $59 million, or 31%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The revenue growth for our deliveries segment in 2023 was driven by our disciplined approach in reducing incentives and a change in business model of certain deliveries offerings in one of our markets which changed the revenue accounting from an agent to a principal based model. Our deliveries revenue benefited by $183 million in 2023 as compared to 2022, from the business model change. For our agent-based business models, we generate revenue through commissions from driver- and merchant-partners, calculated as a percentage of the total dollar value and delivery fee of each GrabFood, GrabKitchen, GrabMart, and GrabExpress order. For GrabKios, we generate revenue by charging a commission on the total value of goods sold by GrabKios agents. Our partner and consumer incentives for deliveries segment were 11%, 11% and 16% of deliveries GMV in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

## Table of Contents

The revenue growth for our mobility segment in 2024 was primarily driven by growth in domestic demand and inbound international tourist demand, which were reflected in increased mobility GMV and mobility MTUs in 2024. Revenue from lease payments from our rentals business is also included in our mobility segment revenues. With the easing and eventual removal of travel and movement restrictions in 2023 and 2022, there was an increased demand for mobility offerings, which was reflected in increased mobility GMV in 2023 and 2022 which drove the growth in revenue. Our partner and consumer incentives for mobility segment remained stable at 8% of mobility GMV in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

* Amount less than $1 million

The revenue growth for our financial services segment in 2024 was primarily attributed to a $41 million growth in our lending businesses through our ecosystem partners and users, and a $29 million growth in our digital banking and payment businesses. Additionally, Segment Adjusted EBITDA improved to $(105) million in 2024 from $(170) in 2023, attributable to the revenue growth of $77 million, along with reductions in overhead expenses of $24 million as we continue to optimize costs. These were partially offset by an increase in costs of $35 million as we continued to ramp up our digital banking business. The revenue growth for our financial services segment in 2023 was primarily attributed to an increase of $87 million in our digital banking business and payment business, and a $15 million growth in our lending businesses.

## B. Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities, loan facilities and equity financing at the subsidiary level.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our assets exceeded our liabilities by $6.4 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively. We incurred a net loss after tax of $0.2 billion and $0.5 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, we had accumulated losses of $17.3 billion as of December 31, 2024.

## Table of Contents

Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in their fair value and are used to manage short-term commitments. Marketable securities consist primarily of investment-grade corporate bonds. Restricted cash and non-current deposits comprise deposits pledged with banks as security in relation to the utilization of certain bank services, monies received and held in escrow in connection with certain contractual obligations and advances received in connection with our electronic wallet or e-wallet services. Our cash and cash equivalents are denominated in U.S. dollars as well as in local currencies of the markets in which we operate.

In February 2024, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $500 million worth of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares. The proposed repurchases may be made from time to time through open market transactions at prevailing market prices, privately negotiated transactions, block trades and/or through other legally permissible means, or any combination thereof, depending on market conditions and the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares, among other factors, and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. Our board of directors will review the share repurchase program periodically, and may amend the terms and size of the program. We have funded, and intend to continue to fund any repurchases with excess cash after allocating and potentially allocating for investments to drive growth. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of Class A ordinary shares. In 2024, pursuant to this program, we repurchased 67 million Class A ordinary shares for an aggregate consideration of $226 million. As of December 31, 2024, $274 million authorized under the share repurchase program remains available for use under the program.

In March 2024, we fully repaid the outstanding principal amount and accrued interest under the Term Loan B Facility.

We believe that our current available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements in the ordinary course of business for a period of at least twelve months from the date hereof and beyond. We intend to finance our future working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements from cash generated from operating activities and funds raised from financing activities. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors including our growth rate, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services, and technologies. Therefore, we may decide to enhance our liquidity position or increase our cash reserve for future investments or operations through additional financing activities, which may include further equity or debt financing. The issuance and sale of additional equity would result in further dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating or financial covenants that restrict our operations.

The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated.

## Notes:

(1) Each item includes expected interest payments.

(2) Non-cancelable purchase obligations pertaining to the purchase of data processing and technology platform infrastructure services.

We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that are not reflected in our financial statements.

## Holding Company Structure

The parent company of our group, Grab Holdings Limited, is a Cayman Islands incorporated investment holding company. It facilitates group treasury activities and international financial transactions such as fund raising but does not have substantive business operations. We conduct our operations in Southeast Asia primarily through our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities. As a result, our ability to pay dividends depends upon dividends paid by our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities. If our existing or future subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us.

In addition, as determined in accordance with local regulations, our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities in certain Southeast Asian markets may be restricted from paying us dividends offshore or from transferring a portion of their assets to us, either in the form of dividends, loans or advances, unless certain requirements are met and regulatory approvals are obtained. Even though we currently do not require any such dividends, loans or advances from our entities for working capital and other funding purposes, we may in the future require additional cash resources from them due to changes in business conditions, to fund future acquisitions and development, or merely to declare and pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders.

Certain of the markets in which we have significant subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities, including Indonesia and Thailand, require those subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities to establish and fund statutory reserves. Indonesian laws require a limited liability company to reserve an unspecified amount from its net profit in any year for which the balance of retained earnings is positive as a reserve fund until such fund amounts to at least 20% of its issued and paid up capital. This mandatory reserve is meant to cover the possibility of losses in the future. It can be in the form of other assets that are easy to liquidate and cannot be distributed as dividends. Regulations in Thailand require a private limited liability company to allocate at least 5% of its retained earnings into a legal reserve fund at the time the dividend is paid until and unless the legal reserve fund reaches 10% of the company's registered capital. The legal reserve is not available for dividend distribution.

The plan became effective on December 1, 2021 and was further amended and restated (as approved by our board of directors) in November 2023. The following summarizes the material terms of the GHL 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the '2021 Plan').

## Table of Contents

Shares Subject to the Plan . Initially, the maximum number of Ordinary Shares that may be issued under the 2021 Plan after it becomes effective is 342,568,055. In addition, the number of Ordinary Shares reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year, starting on January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2031, in an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the total number of Ordinary Shares that are outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors or a committee thereof. For January 1, 2022, January 1, 2023, January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025, the Compensation Committee determined that there shall be no increase, a 200 million increase, a 218 million increase and a 80 million increase, respectively, in the number of Ordinary Shares that may be issued under the 2021 Plan. Therefore, as of the date of this annual report, the maximum number of Ordinary Shares that may be issued under the 2021 Plan, including past and future issuances, is 840,568,055.

If an award (or any portion thereof) expires or otherwise terminates without all shares covered by the award having been issued or is settled in cash, such expiration, termination or settlement will not reduce the number of Ordinary Shares that may be available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. Any Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to an award that are forfeited or repurchased, and any Ordinary Shares reacquired in satisfaction of any tax withholding on an award or reacquired in satisfaction of the exercise or purchase price of an award, will become available for issuance under the 2021 Plan.

In connection with certain corporate transactions with another entity, awards under the 2021 Plan may be granted in substitution for any options or other share or share-based awards granted before such corporate transaction by such other entity, and any such substitute awards will not count against the share reserve under the 2021 Plan.

Awards made to the Key Executives under the 2021 Plan that replace such Key Executive's outstanding options, restricted share units, and restricted shares under the 2018 Plan in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination and any other awards granted to the Key Executives under the 2021 Plan shall be granted for Class B Ordinary Shares. Awards made to our executive officers (other than the Key Executives) under the 2021 Plan shall be granted for Class B Ordinary Shares and/or Class A Ordinary Shares. All other awards under the 2021 Plan shall be granted for Class A Ordinary Shares.

Capitalization Adjustment . In the event there is a specified type of change in our capital structure, such as a share split, reverse share split, or recapitalization, appropriate adjustments will be made to (i) the class and maximum number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan, (ii) the class and maximum number of shares by which the share reserve may increase automatically each year, (iii) the class and maximum number of shares that may be issued on the exercise of incentive stock options, and (iv) the class and number of shares and exercise price, strike price, or purchase price, if applicable, of all outstanding share awards.

Types of Awards . The 2021 Plan permits the awards of options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units ('RSUs') and other awards.

Eligibility . Employees, directors and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible to participate in the 2021 Plan.

Non-Employee Director Compensation Limit . Beginning with calendar year 2022, the aggregate value of all new compensation granted or paid to any non-employee director with respect to any calendar year, including share awards granted and cash fees paid by the Company to such non-employee director, will not exceed $750,000 in total value, or in the event such non-employee director is first appointed or elected to the board during such calendar year, $1,000,000 in total value (in each case, calculating the value of any such share awards based on the grant date fair value of such share awards for financial reporting purposes).

Plan Administration . Our compensation committee, as delegated by the board of directors, administers the 2021 Plan. The administrator determines the participants to receive awards, when and how awards will be granted, the type of award to be granted, the number of awards to be granted, and the other terms and conditions of each award. The administrator may delegate certain authorities under the 2021 Plan to one or more officers of GHL.

Award Agreements . Awards granted under the 2021 Plan are evidenced by award agreements that set forth, consistent with the 2021 Plan, the terms, conditions and limitations for each award.

## Table of Contents

Conditions of Awards . The administrator determines the provisions, terms and conditions of each award granted under the 2021 Plan, including but not limited to the vesting schedule of the awards.

Change in Control . In the event of a change in control, the administrator may take one or more of the following actions with respect to outstanding awards under the 2021 Plan: arrange for the surviving or acquiring corporation to assume or continue or substitute the award, arrange for the assignment or lapse of any reacquisition or repurchase rights, accelerate the vesting, cancel any award that is unvested or not exercised in exchange for such cash consideration (if any) as determined by the administrator, and make a payment (in such form as determined by the administrator) equal to the excess (if any) of the value the participant would have received upon the exercise of the award immediately prior to the change in control over any exercise price payable by such holder.

Termination . Unless suspended or terminated earlier, the 2021 Plan has a term of ten years from April 12, 2021. Our board of directors has the authority to suspend or terminate the 2021 Plan at any time, provided, however, that no such suspension or termination may impair the rights and obligations under any awards previously granted without the written consent of the participant.

## 2021 Equity Stock Purchase Plan

In April 2021, our board of directors adopted, and our shareholders approved the GHL 2021 Equity Stock Purchase Plan (the 'ESPP'). The ESPP consists of two components: a Section 423 component, which is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code (the 'Code') and a nonSection 423 component, which need not qualify under Section 423 of the Code. The ESPP became effective on December 1, 2021. As of the date of this annual report, 11,369,230 Class A Ordinary Shares have been issued under the 2021 ESPP. The following summarizes the material terms of the ESPP.

Shares Subject to the Plan . Initially, the maximum number of Class A Ordinary Shares that may be issued under the ESPP after it becomes effective is two percent (2%) of the total number of Ordinary Shares that are outstanding upon consummation of the Business Combination, which maximum number is equal to 74,821,802. In addition, the number of Class A Ordinary Shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year, starting on January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2031, in an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the total number of Ordinary Shares that are outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares determined by the administrator. For January 1, 2022, January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2025, the Compensation Committee determined that there shall be no increase in the number of Class A Ordinary Shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP. For January 1, 2024, the Compensation Committee determined that there shall be an increase of 20 million Class A Ordinary Shares under the ESPP. As a result, as of the date of this annual report, the maximum number of Class A Ordinary Shares that may be issued under the ESPP, including past and future issuances, is 94,821,802.

Plan Administration . Our board of directors or, as delegated by the board of directors, the compensation committee of the board of directors, administers the ESPP. The administrator may delegate certain authorities under the ESPP to one or more officers.

Eligibility . Employees and other service providers of the Company and its designated subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible to participate in the ESPP if they meet the eligibility requirements under the ESPP established from time to time by the administrator. However, an employee may not be granted rights to purchase shares under the 423 Component of the ESPP if such employee, immediately after the grant, would own (directly or through attribution) shares possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of ordinary shares.

Participation . Employees will enroll under the ESPP by completing a payroll deduction form permitting the deduction from their compensation of at least 1% of their compensation but not more than 15% of their compensation. Such payroll deductions will be expressed as a whole number percentage, and the accumulated deductions will be applied to the purchase of shares on each purchase date. However, a participant may not accrue the right to purchase Class A Ordinary Shares under the ESPP at a rate that exceeds $25,000 in fair market value of Class A Ordinary Shares (determined at the time the option is granted) (or in the case of the non-Section 423 component, such other amount as may be determined by the administrator) for each calendar year the option is outstanding (as determined in accordance with Section 423 of the Code).

## Table of Contents

Offering . Under the ESPP, participants are offered the option to purchase Class A Ordinary Shares at a discount during an offering period. The length of offering periods under the ESPP will be determined by the administrator and may be up to 27 months long. Payroll deductions will be used to purchase Class A Ordinary Shares on each purchase date during an offering period. The number of purchase periods within, and purchase dates during, each offering period will be established by the administrator. Offering periods under the ESPP will commence when determined by the administrator. The administrator may, in its discretion, modify the terms of future offering periods.

The option purchase price will be the lower of not less than 85% of the closing trading price of a Class A Ordinary Share on the first day of an offering period in which a participant is enrolled or not less than 85% of the closing trading price of a Class A Ordinary Share on the purchase date, which will occur on the last day of each purchase period.

Unless a participant has previously canceled his or her participation in the ESPP before the purchase date, the participant will be deemed to have exercised his or her option in full as of each purchase date. Upon exercise, the participant will purchase the number of whole shares that his or her accumulated payroll deductions will buy at the option purchase price, subject to the participation limitations listed above.

A participant may cancel his or her payroll deduction authorization at any time prior to the end of the offering period. Upon cancellation, the participant will receive a refund of the participant's account balance in cash without interest. A participant may also decrease (but not increase) his or her payroll deduction authorization once during any purchase period. If a participant wants to increase or decrease the rate of payroll withholding, he or she may do so effective for the next offering period by submitting a new form before the offering period for which such change is to be effective.

Transferability . A participant may not transfer rights granted under the ESPP other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as otherwise provided in the ESPP.

Certain transactions . In the event of certain transactions or events affecting the Class A Ordinary Shares, such as any share dividend, share split, reverse share split, split-up, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, or other capital change, the administrator will make appropriate adjustments to the ESPP and outstanding rights. In addition, in the event of certain significant transactions, including a change in control, the administrator may (1) if the Company is merged with or acquired by another corporation, provide that each outstanding option will be assumed or exchanged for a substitute option granted by the acquirer or successor corporation or by a parent or subsidiary of the acquirer or successor corporation, (2) cancel each outstanding option and return the balances to the accounts of the participants, without interest, and/or (3) terminate the offering period on or before the date of the proposed sale, merger or similar transaction and provide that any outstanding options will be exercisable either on the purchase date for the applicable offering period or an earlier date as the administrator may specify or return the balances to the accounts of the participants, without interest.

Plan amendment; termination . The administrator may amend, suspend or terminate the ESPP at any time. However, shareholder approval of any amendment to the ESPP must be obtained within twelve months before or after any amendment that would be treated as the adoption of a new plan for purposes of Section 423. The ESPP will terminate on December 1, 2031.

In addition to the above share incentive plans of Grab Holdings Limited, certain of our subsidiaries have set up equity settled share-based payment arrangements for the issuance of restricted share units/awards and share options that are generally subject to a vesting schedule.

## Share Award Grants

The share awards that have been granted under the 2021 Plan are service-based or performance-based. Service-based awards vest in equal portions over a prescribed service period, and performance-based awards vest upon the satisfaction of both service-based and performance-based conditions. A performance-based award will not vest if none of the performance conditions are met even though the service-based conditions are met.

## C. Board Practices

## Board of Directors

Our board of directors consists of seven directors as of the date of this annual report. Of these seven directors, five are independent. These independent directors were selected and approved by our nominating committee through a process that sought to find diversity of experience, expertise and perspectives, as well as deep understandings of different businesses, practices and markets relevant to our operations. The number of directors may be increased to up to nine or reduced to any number smaller than nine, if and as determined by the holders of a majority of the Class B Ordinary Shares, voting exclusively and as a separate class. A director may vote in respect of any contract or transaction in which he/she is interested provided that the nature of the interest of any director in any such contract or transaction is disclosed at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon, and such director may be counted in the quorum at any meeting of directors at which any such contract or transaction is considered. A director who is interested in a contract or proposed contract with us must declare the nature of his or her interest at a meeting of the directors. No non-employee director has a service contract with us that provides for benefits upon termination of service.

## Duties of Directors

Under the laws of the Cayman Islands, directors have a fiduciary duty to act honestly in good faith with a view to the company's best interests. Our directors also have a duty to exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. A shareholder has the right to seek damages if a duty owed by the directors is breached.

## Table of Contents

## Terms of Directors and Executive Officers

A majority of our directors are nominated and appointed by the holders of Class B Ordinary Shares voting exclusively and as a separate class. The balance of our directors is elected by the holders of Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class. Other than Ms. Ong Chin Yin, no director is subject to a term of office and each will hold office until the earliest to occur of the following: (a) the director's successor has been elected; (b) the director dies, becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his or her creditors; (c) (i) with respect to any director other than Mr. Tan, a licensed medical practitioner who has evaluated that director gives a written opinion to us stating he or she has become physically or mentally incapable of acting as a director and may remain so for more than three months or (ii) with respect to Mr. Tan, a licensed medical practitioner determines that Mr. Tan has a permanent and total disability so that he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or that has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months; (d) such director resigns his or her office by notice in writing to us; or (e) such director is removed as described in the following paragraph. Ms. Ong Chin Yin is subject to a term of office originally until December 31, 2024, which has been renewed and extended until March 31, 2025, subject to further renewal.

## Foreign Private Issuer Status

We are an exempted company limited by shares incorporated in 2021 under the laws of the Cayman Islands. We report under the Exchange Act as a non-U.S. company with foreign private issuer status. Under Rule 405 of the Securities Act, the determination of foreign private issuer status is made annually on the last business day of an issuer's most recently completed second fiscal quarter. For so long as we qualify as a foreign private issuer, we will be exempt from certain provisions of the Exchange Act that are applicable to U.S. domestic public companies, including:

- · the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC;
- · the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents, or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act;

- · the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation Fair Disclosure, or Regulation FD, which regulates selective disclosure of material non-public information by issuers.

We are required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we have published and intend to continue to publish our results on a quarterly basis through press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Press releases relating to financial results and material events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. Accordingly, our shareholders will receive less or different information about us than a shareholder of a U.S. domestic public company would receive.

We are a non-U.S. company with foreign private issuer status and are listed on NASDAQ. NASDAQ market rules permit a foreign private issuer like us to follow the corporate governance practices of our home country. Certain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is our home country, may differ significantly from NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards. Among other things, we are not required to have:

- · a majority-independent board of directors;
- · a compensation committee consisting of independent directors;
- · a nominating committee consisting of independent directors; or
- · regularly scheduled executive sessions with only independent directors each year.

In addition, we are not required to have our shareholders approve certain issuances of securities, including those in connection with the establishment of or material amendments to equity compensation plans or arrangements.

## Table of Contents

Although not required and as may be changed from time to time, we have a majority-independent board of directors, a majority-independent compensation committee and a nominating committee. Subject to the foregoing, we intend to rely on the exemptions listed above. As a result, you may not be provided with the benefits of certain corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ applicable to U.S. domestic public companies.

## Code of Business Conduct and Ethics

We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We seek to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics sets out the principles designed to guide our business practices-compliance, integrity, respect and dedication. The code applies to all directors, officers, employees and extended workforce. We expect our suppliers, contractors, consultants, and other business partners to follow the principles set forth in our code when providing goods and services to us or acting on our behalf.

## D. Employees

Our employees are critical to our success and have scaled in line with the growth of the business. As such, we focus on cultivating a values-driven corporate culture anchored around the 4H principles, which serve to guide our employees towards our mission to drive Southeast Asia forward by creating economic empowerment for everyone. Each of the 4Hs is demonstrated daily through a set of behaviors that define The Grab Way:

- · Heart : To serve Grab's communities, we aim to take a long-term view to understanding and balancing the needs of our driver- and merchant-partners and the consumers on our platform and gain strength through teamwork as one organization rather than focusing on individual functions or business lines.
- · Hunger : We value dedication, drive and adaptability in responding to our challenges in creative ways and encourage our people to learn from mistakes, seek feedback and provide help to others.
- · Honor : Integrity is a key enabler of our mission for all our stakeholders, and we strive to build successful marketplaces grounded in trust.
- · Humility : We recognize that there is always room for growth and seek to learn from consumers, partners, communities and employees.

We firmly believe that The Grab Way fosters a collaborative, innovative and respectful work environment that makes Grab one of the best places to work in Southeast Asia. The following table indicates the distribution of our full-time employees by function as of December 31, 2024:

| Function                                   | Number   |

In addition, as of December 31, 2024, we had 1,299 fixed-term contract employees and 3,795 temporary agency workers.

However, these shares are not included in the computation of the percentage ownership of any other person. Each Class A Ordinary Share carries one vote, and each Class B Ordinary Share carries 45 votes.

The percentage of our Ordinary Shares beneficially owned is computed on the basis of 3,954,639,393 Class A Ordinary Shares and 119,498,676 Class B Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding as of February 15, 2025, and does not include the 25,999,981 Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon the Warrants outstanding as of February 15, 2025.

Pursuant to the Shareholders' Deed, Ms. Tan, Mr. Maa and any trusts created by Ms. Tan or Mr. Maa irrevocably appoints Mr. Tan as attorney-in-fact and proxy to vote all of their Class B Ordinary Shares. This table does not include 1,111,904 Class B Ordinary Shares that Mr. Tan beneficially owns as of the date of this annual report pursuant to the Voting Proxy Deeds signed in March 2025 among GHL, Mr. Tan and our executive officers (other than Mr. Tan). Under the Voting Proxy Deeds, each of our executive officers (other than Mr. Tan) irrevocably appoints Mr. Tan as attorney-in-fact and proxy to vote all of their Class B Ordinary Shares. As a result, as of February 15, 2025, after giving effect to the Exco Proxies (in addition to the Key Executive Proxies), Mr. Tan controlled approximately 63.4% of the total voting power of all issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class.
- (4) The number of Class A Ordinary Shares beneficially owned was reported in the Form 13F filed by SB Investment Advisers (UK) Limited on February 14, 2025.

Because many of these shares are held by brokers or other nominees, we cannot ascertain the exact number of Class A Ordinary Shares ultimately held by holders in the United States. As of February 15, 2025, 6,215,298 Class B Ordinary Shares representing 5.2% of the total issued and outstanding Class B Ordinary Shares, were held by two record holders in the United States.

We are not aware of any arrangement that may, at a subsequent date, result in a change of control of our company.

## Transactions with GrabFin Operations (Malaysia)

On October 15, 2019, pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement dated August 20, 2018, and the supplemental agreement dated April 3, 2019, Grab Financial Services Asia Inc.

Prior to the foregoing transactions, the shares in GOM were owned by two individuals holding 10% and 30%, respectively, and Mr. Kooi Ong Tong (60%), who is Mr. Tan's father-in-law. In May 2023, we acquired Mr. Tong's 60% interest in GOM and we now wholly own GOM. As a result, GOM ceased to be our related party in May 2023.

GFSA can demand repayment of all or any amounts outstanding under the Loan Agreement at its absolute discretion at any time, and any outstanding amount is due within five business days from GOM having received demand from GFSA.

## Contract with National University of Singapore

We have a contract with the National University of Singapore's NUS AI Lab for artificial intelligence research and intellectual property creation related to our business for SGD 1.25 million (approximately $0.9 million) over two years from April 1, 2021.

## Shareholding in Jaya Grocer

In January 2022 we completed the acquisition of a majority economic interest in Jaya Grocer. Our supermarkets business is subject to the Guidelines on Foreign Participation in Distributive Trade Services in Malaysia (2022) issued by the Malaysian Ministry of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living, which stipulate a maximum foreign voting cap of 50% for smaller retail formats (non-superstores) in Malaysia. Accordingly, 50% of the ordinary shares in Jaya Grocer are held by an entity ('Malaysian local partner') owned by a Malaysian national, who used to be, until October 2023, our co-founder Hooi Ling Tan (who no longer holds any position at Grab since December 31, 2023). The entity is now owned by one of our employees. The full purchase of the ordinary shares in Jaya Grocer by the Malaysian local partner was funded through the purchase of preference shares in the Malaysian local partner by us. We, through a wholly owned subsidiary, have entered into a management agreement with Jaya Grocer and the Malaysian local partner that generally entitles us to decide, among others, on business and financial strategies, including funding, and other strategy matters in relation to the business of Jaya Grocer, in the best interest of Jaya Grocer and in consultation with the Malaysian local partner.

## Contract with MCars Sdn. Bhd.

This was conducted through a competitive bidding exercise considering the best price and the ability to fulfill payment as per bidding document. Initially, it was awarded to another company that was the highest bidder, but the company was not able to fulfill payment as per the bidding document. As a result, it was awarded to the next highest bidder, MCars. Sdn. Bhd. MCars Sdn. Bhd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orion SPV Pte. Ltd., a company 49%-owned by Ideal Team Enterprises Limited, which is in turn owned by Nicholas Tan, Mr. Tan's brother.

Bhd. is owned, directly and indirectly, by Tan Chong Consolidated Sdn Bhd, a company wholly owned by members of the Tan family, including Dato Tan Heng Chew, Mr. Anthony Tan's father.

## Legal Proceedings

We are from time to time involved in private actions, collective actions, class actions, investigations and various other legal proceedings by consumers, driver- and merchant-partners, restaurants, employees, commercial partners, competitors and government agencies, among others, relating to, for example, personal injury or property damage cases, employment or labor-related disputes such as wrongful termination of employment, consumer complaints, disputes with driver- and merchant-partners, contractual disputes with suppliers or commercial partners, disputes with third parties and regulatory inquiries and proceedings relating to compliance with competition, privacy or other applicable regulations. We may also initiate various legal proceedings such as against former employees, suppliers or driver- and merchant-partners to enforce our rights. There are inherent uncertainties in these matters, some of which are beyond our management's control, making the ultimate outcomes difficult to predict.

Information is provided below regarding the nature and status of certain legal proceedings against Grab. Other than as set forth below, we are not a party to, nor are we aware of, any legal proceeding, investigation or claim which, in the opinion of our management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

## Government Proceedings

We have been, and are currently, involved in actions brought by government authorities and third parties, alleging violations of competition laws, consumer protection laws, data protection laws and other laws. We dispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. For example, on October 3, 2019, the Malaysia Competition Commission, or MyCC, served a proposed decision against Grabcar Sdn. Bhd., MyTeksi Sdn. Bhd. and Grab Inc. for allegedly abusing Grab's dominant position by restricting driver-partners from promoting competitors' products and providing advertising services to third-party enterprises. MyCC imposed a proposed financial penalty of MYR 86.8 million (approximately $19.4 million), along with the directive for MyTeksi Sdn. Bhd. and Grabcar Sdn. Bhd. to remove the restrictive clause permanently from the relevant terms and code of conduct and to notify all driver-partners of such removal for a period of twelve weeks. As of the date of this annual report, MyCC has not issued a final decision. Grabcar Sdn. Bhd., MyTeksi Sdn. Bhd. and Grab Inc.'s initial leave application to the High Court for a judicial review of MyCC's proposed decision was dismissed and they have since been granted leave by the Court of Appeal to have the judicial review application against MyCC's proposed decision heard in the High Court. The MyCC has appealed to the Federal Court and the appeal has been dismissed. In July 2023, the High Court ruled to quash the proposed decision, including the proposed fines. In August 2023, MyCC filed a Notice of Appeal to appeal against the High Court's decision at the Court of Appeal. Currently the matter is pending the Court of Appeal's decision on MyCC's appeal.

In Indonesia, KPPU has raised its concern on the fairness in partnerships between large and medium enterprises with small and micro enterprises. KPPU started to investigate our partnership arrangements for GrabExpress and GrabFood in Indonesia with our driver-partners, whom KPPU considers to be small and micro enterprises. We have attended relevant meetings and have made submissions to KPPU related to the investigation since November 2024. The result of this investigation remains uncertain.

## Personal Injury Matters

In the ordinary course of our business, various parties have from time to time claimed, and may claim in the future, that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving driver-partners or passengers using or who have used services offered through our platform, as well as from third parties. For example, in August 2020, a passenger who was injured in an accident while using GrabBike, filed a claim in the Thai Civil Court against Grabtaxi Holdings Pte. Ltd., Grabtaxi (Thailand) Co., Ltd. and the driver-partner for approximately THB 53 million (approximately $1.6 million) in damages. Our management is of the view that the claim amount is exaggerated and the plaintiff is unlikely to be able to substantiate the total amount of the claim. In May 2024, the Court of First Instance rendered a judgment holding us jointly liable with the driver-partner (who is one of the defendants), even though the court acknowledged that the driver is not our employee. The court also awarded to the plaintiff compensation in the amount of approximately THB 5 million (approximately $0.1 million), excluding interest. We believe that the compensation amount was awarded without justifiable legal reasons, as it was not based on provable evidence or actual damage calculations. We filed an appeal with the Appeal Court in October 2024. The case is still pending and ongoing.

## Independent Contractor Matters

In the ordinary course of our business, various driver-partners have challenged, and may challenge in the future, their classification on our platform as independent contractors, seeking monetary, injunctive, or other relief although we have generally been able to defend such actions. We were previously involved in one such action filed by an individual driver-partner seeking damages for wrongful termination. On January 3, 2020, a former driverpartner filed a claim against MyTeksi Sdn Bhd in the Kuala Lumpur Industrial Relations Department alleging unfair dismissal from the Grab platform. The Minister of Human Resources declined to refer the driver-partner's claim to the Industrial Relations Court based on his sole discretion, and the former driverpartner's subsequent application to the Kuala Lumpur High Court for judicial review of the Minister's decision was also dismissed. The former driver-partner filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal, which was dismissed. The former driver-partner then applied for leave to appeal at the Federal Court, and it was also dismissed, which meant that she had exhausted all avenues of appeal and the outcome was final. In addition, we are also regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings seeking to hold us liable for the actions of independent contractors on our platform.

## Other Actions

We are currently also involved in the following actions:

- · In December 2018, Grab was assessed approximately PHP 1.4 billion (approximately $25.3 million) in the Philippines for an alleged deficiency in local business taxes. We are contesting this assessment and the case remains under review by the regional trial court.
- · On September 21, 2021, Grab Greco LLP was served with a claim in the Bangalore City Civil Court in India by a former employee and a company from which Grab Greco LLP had acquired intellectual property assets in 2018. The plaintiffs allege that Grab's wallet platform breaches the plaintiffs' intellectual property rights. The relief sought from the Bangalore City Civil Court includes an injunction to restrain Grab from using the claimants' purported copyright and patents and an account of profits. Grab believes the case has no merit and is contesting it on the basis that, among other things, Grab completed the purchase of the relevant intellectual property in 2018. The case was dismissed on May 31, 2023 but the plaintiffs have since filed a petition to review the dismissal and the petition is pending.

Beginning in March 2022, various putative shareholder class action lawsuits were filed against our Company and certain of its officers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On June 7, 2022, the Court appointed Lead Plaintiffs and consolidated all actions under the caption In re Grab Holdings Limited Securities Litigation, No. 1:22-cv-02189-VM. On August 22, 2022, Lead Plaintiffs filed an Amended Class Action Complaint against the Company, certain of its officers and directors, and certain officers and directors of Altimeter Growth Corp. The class action is purportedly brought on behalf of various classes of persons who allegedly suffered damages as a result of alleged misstatements and omissions regarding our proxy and registration statements, business operations, potential impact on our financial results, and future prospects, in violation of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 14(a), and 20(a) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. On November 18, 2022, the Company and the other defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint. Briefing on the motion to dismiss was completed on February 27, 2023. On March 12, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants' motion to dismiss. On January 13, 2025, the Court granted preliminary approval of a settlement agreement for $80 million. The Company expects a portion of the cost of settlement will be covered by applicable litigation insurance policies.

## Dividend Policy

We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our Class A Ordinary Shares. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any further determination to pay dividends on our ordinary shares would be at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and would depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.

## E. Taxation

## United States Federal Income Tax Considerations

## General

The following is a general discussion of the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the ownership and disposition of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants (the 'Securities').

This summary is limited to U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to U.S. Holders (as defined below) that hold Securities as 'capital assets' within the meaning of section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code') (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to holders in light of their individual circumstances, including holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. tax laws, such as, for example:

- · our officers or directors;
- · banks, financial institutions or financial services entities;
- · broker-dealers;
- · taxpayers that are subject to the mark-to-market accounting rules;
- · tax-exempt entities;

## Table of Contents

- · S-corporations;
- · governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof;
- · insurance companies;
- · regulated investment companies;
- · real estate investment trusts;
- · expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States;
- · persons that actually or constructively own five percent or more of our shares by vote or value;
- · persons that acquired Securities pursuant to an exercise of employee share options, in connection with employee share incentive plans or otherwise as compensation or in connection with services;
- · persons that hold Securities as part of a straddle, constructive sale, hedging, conversion or other integrated or similar transaction; or
- · U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

As used in this annual report, the term 'U.S. Holder' means a beneficial owner of Securities that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

- · an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
- · a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is created or organized (or treated as created or organized) in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
- · an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
- · a trust if (A) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (B) it has in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person.

Moreover, the discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be repealed, revoked, modified or subject to differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the U.S. federal income tax treatment described below or that, if challenged, such treatment will be sustained by a court. Furthermore, this discussion does not address any aspect of U.S. federal non-income tax laws, such as, gift, estate, Medicare contribution, or minimum tax laws, or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws relating to the ownership and disposition of Securities.

This discussion does not consider the tax treatment of partnerships or other pass-through entities or persons who hold Securities through such entities. If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is the beneficial owner of Securities, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding Securities, we urge you to consult your own tax advisor.

THIS SUMMARY DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF OWNING AND DISPOSING OF SECURITIES. HOLDERS OF SECURITIES SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF SECURITIES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND OTHER TAX LAWS.

## Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations

A non-U.S. corporation will generally be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income or (ii) at least 50% of the value of its assets (generally determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income. Passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and gains from the disposition of passive assets. In addition, a non-U.S. corporation will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which it owns, directly or indirectly, 25% or more (by value) of the stock.

Based upon the value of our assets and the composition of our income and assets, including goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, we do not believe we were a PFIC for our taxable year ended December 31, 2024. No assurances can be given with regard to our PFIC status for our current or subsequent taxable years because our PFIC status is a factual determination made annually after the close of each taxable year that will depend, in part, on the composition of our income and assets. Because the value of our assets for purposes of the asset test may be determined by reference to the market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares from time to time (which may be volatile), fluctuations in the market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares may cause us to be or become a PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable years. Recent declines in the market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares significantly increased our risk of being or becoming a PFIC. The market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares may continue to fluctuate considerably and, consequently, we cannot assure you of our PFIC status for any taxable year. In addition, the composition of our income and assets will also be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets. As previously disclosed, we believed that we were a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, it is possible that one or more of our subsidiaries were also PFICs for U.S. federal income tax purposes for such taxable year.

If we are classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds our Class A Ordinary Shares or Warrants, we will generally continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder holds our Class A Ordinary Shares or Warrants, unless we were to cease to be a PFIC and such U.S. Holder were to make a 'deemed sale' election with respect to the Class A Ordinary Shares or Warrants.

## Taxation of Distributions

Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below under '-Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules', a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include in gross income as a dividend the amount of any distribution paid on our Class A Ordinary Shares to the extent the distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). Such dividends paid by us will be taxable to a corporate U.S. Holder at regular rates and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to domestic corporations in respect of dividends received from other domestic corporations. Subject to the PFIC rules described below under '-Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules', distributions in excess of such earnings and profits generally will be applied against and reduce the U.S. Holder's basis in our Class A Ordinary Shares (but not below zero) and, to the extent in excess of such basis, will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such ordinary shares (see '-Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants' below).

With respect to non-corporate U.S. Holders, under tax laws currently in effect and subject to certain exceptions (including, but not limited to, dividends treated as investment income for purposes of investment interest deduction limitations), dividends generally will be taxed at the lower applicable long-term capital gains rate (see '-Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants' below) provided that our Class A Ordinary Shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States, and we are not treated as a PFIC in the year the dividend is paid or in the preceding year and certain holding period and other requirements are met. U.S. Treasury Department guidance indicates that shares listed on NASDAQ (on which our Class A Ordinary Shares are listed) will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. Even if the Class A Ordinary Shares are listed on NASDAQ, there can be no assurance that our Class A Ordinary Shares will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in future years.

As previously disclosed, we believed that we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2022, and, as discussed above, no assurances can be given with regard to our PFIC status for our current or subsequent taxable years. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced tax rate on dividends with respect to Securities under their particular circumstances.

## Table of Contents

## Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants

Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below under '-Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules', a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition of our Class A Ordinary Shares or Warrants in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition and such U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in such Class A Ordinary Shares or Warrants. Any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's holding period for such Class A Ordinary Shares or Warrants exceeds one year. Long-term capital gain realized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder is currently eligible to be taxed at reduced rates. Any such gain or loss that the U.S. Holder recognizes will generally be treated as U.S. source income or loss for foreign tax credit limitation purposes, which will generally limit the availability of foreign tax credits. The deduction of capital losses is subject to certain limitations.

As previously disclosed, we believed that we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2022, and, as discussed above, no assurances can be given with regard to our PFIC status for our current or subsequent taxable years. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced tax rate on dividends with respect to Securities under their particular circumstances.

## Exercise, Lapse or Redemption of a Warrant

Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below under '-Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules' and except as discussed below with respect to the cashless exercise of a warrant, a U.S. Holder generally will not recognize gain or loss upon the acquisition of a Class A Ordinary Share on the exercise of a Warrant. A U.S. Holder's tax basis in a Class A Ordinary Share received upon exercise of the Warrant generally will be an amount equal to the sum of the U.S. Holder's tax basis in the Warrant exchanged therefor and the exercise price. The U.S. Holder's holding period for a Class A Ordinary Share received upon exercise of the Warrant will begin on the date following the date of exercise (or possibly the date of exercise) of the Warrant and will not include the period during which the U.S. Holder held the Warrant. If a Warrant is allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such holder's tax basis in the Warrant.

The tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a warrant are not clear under current law. Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below under 'Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules', a cashless exercise may not be taxable, either because the exercise is not a realization event or because the exercise is treated as a 'recapitalization' for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although we expect a U.S. Holder's cashless exercise of our warrants (including after we provide notice of our intent to redeem warrants for cash) to be treated as a recapitalization, a cashless exercise could alternatively be treated as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized.

In either tax-free situation, a U.S. Holder's tax basis in the Class A Ordinary Shares received generally would equal the U.S. Holder's tax basis in the Warrants. If the cashless exercise is not treated as a realization event, it is unclear whether a U.S. Holder's holding period for the Class A Ordinary Share will commence on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the warrant. If the cashless exercise is treated as a recapitalization, the holding period of the Class A Ordinary Shares would include the holding period of the warrants.

It is also possible that a cashless exercise may be treated in part as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized. In such event, a portion of the Warrants to be exercised on a cashless basis could, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be deemed to have been surrendered in consideration for the exercise price of the remaining Warrants, which would be deemed to be exercised. For this purpose, a U.S. Holder may be deemed to have surrendered a number of Warrants having an aggregate value equal to the exercise price for the total number of Warrants to be deemed exercised. Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below under '-Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules', the U.S. Holder would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the total number of Warrants deemed surrendered and the U.S. Holder's tax basis in such Warrants. In this case, a U.S. Holder's tax basis in the Class A Ordinary Shares received would equal the U.S. Holder's tax basis in the Warrants exercised plus (or minus) the gain (or loss) recognized with respect to the surrendered Warrants. It is unclear whether a U.S. Holder's holding period for the Class A Ordinary Shares would commence on the date of exercise of the Warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the Warrant.

Because of the absence of authority on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise, there can be no assurance which, if any, of the alternative tax consequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder should consult its tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of a cashless exercise.

## Table of Contents

Subject to the PFIC rules described below under '-Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules', if we redeem warrants for cash or purchase warrants in an open market transaction, such redemption or purchase generally will be treated as a taxable disposition to the U.S. Holder, taxed as described above under '-Exercise, Lapse or Redemption of a Warrant.'

As previously disclosed, we believed that we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2022, and, as discussed above, no assurances can be given with regard to our PFIC status for our current or subsequent taxable years. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced tax rate on dividends with respect to Securities under their particular circumstances.

## Possible Constructive Distributions

The terms of each Warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of Class A Ordinary Shares for which the Warrant may be exercised or to the exercise price of the warrant in certain events, as discussed in the section captioned 'Description of Warrants' contained in Exhibit 2.5 to this annual report, which is incorporated herein by reference. An adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable. The U.S. Holders of the Warrants would, however, be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if, for example, the adjustment increases such U.S. Holders' proportionate interests in our assets or earnings and profits (e.g. through an increase in the number of Class A Ordinary Shares that would be obtained upon exercise or through a decrease to the exercise price of a Warrant) as a result of a distribution of cash or other property to the holders of Class A Ordinary Shares which is taxable to the U.S. Holders of such Class A Ordinary Shares as described under '-Taxation of Distributions' above. Such constructive distribution would be subject to tax as described under that section in the same manner as if the U.S. Holders of the warrants received a cash distribution from us equal to the fair market value of such increased interest, and would increase a U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in its Warrants to the extent that such distribution is treated as a dividend.

## Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules

If we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder of Class A Ordinary Shares or Warrants and, in the case of Class A Ordinary Shares, the U.S. Holder did not make a qualified electing fund ('QEF') election or a mark-tomarket election, such U.S. Holder generally would be subject to special and adverse rules, regardless of whether we remain a PFIC, with respect to (i) any gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of its Class A Ordinary Shares or Warrants and (ii) any 'excess distribution' made to the U.S. Holder (generally, any distributions to such U.S. Holder during a taxable year of the U.S. Holder that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by such U.S. Holder in respect of the Class A Ordinary Shares during the three preceding taxable years of such U.S. Holder or, if shorter, such U.S. Holder's holding period for the Class A Ordinary Shares).

## Under these rules:

- · the U.S. Holder's gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder's holding period for the Class A Ordinary Shares or Warrants;
- · the amount allocated to the U.S. Holder's taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution, or to the period in the U.S. Holder's holding period before the first day of our first taxable year in which we were a PFIC, will be taxed as ordinary income;
- · the amount allocated to other taxable years (or portions thereof) of the U.S. Holder and included in its holding period will be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for that year and applicable to the U.S. Holder; and
- · an additional tax equal to the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the U.S. Holder with respect to the tax attributable to each such other taxable year of the U.S. Holder.

## Table of Contents

If we are a PFIC and, at any time, have a non-U.S. subsidiary that is classified as a PFIC (a 'low-tier PFIC'), a U.S. Holder generally would be deemed to own a portion of the shares of such lower-tier PFIC, and generally could incur liability for the deferred tax and interest charge described above if we (or our subsidiary) receive a distribution from, or disposes of all or part of its interest in, the lower-tier PFIC or the U.S. Holders otherwise were deemed to have disposed of an interest in the lower-tier PFIC. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax issues raised by lower-tier PFICs.

We do not expect to furnish U.S. Holders with the tax information necessary to enable a U.S. Holder to make a QEF election which, if available, would result in tax treatment different from (and generally less adverse than) the general tax treatment for PFICs described above.

Alternatively, if we are a PFIC and the Class A Ordinary Shares constitute 'marketable stock' (as defined below), a U.S. Holder may avoid the adverse PFIC tax consequences discussed above if such U.S. Holder, at the close of the first taxable year in which it holds (or is deemed to hold) the Class A Ordinary Shares, makes a mark-to-market election with respect to such shares for such taxable year. Such U.S. Holder generally will include for each of its taxable years as ordinary income the excess, if any, of the fair market value of its Class A Ordinary Shares at the end of such year over its adjusted basis in its Class A Ordinary Shares. The U.S. Holder also will recognize an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of its adjusted basis of its Class A Ordinary Shares over the fair market value of its Class A Ordinary Shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election). The U.S. Holder's basis in its Class A Ordinary Shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts, and any further gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of its Class A Ordinary Shares will be treated as ordinary income. If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election in respect of a corporation classified as a PFIC and such corporation ceases to be classified as a PFIC, the U.S. Holder will not be required to take into account the gain or loss described above during any period that such corporation is not classified as a PFIC. Currently, a markto-market election may not be made with respect to Warrants.

The mark-to-market election is available only for 'marketable stock,' generally, stock that is traded in other than de minimis quantities on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter ('regularly traded') on a national securities exchange that is registered with the SEC, including NASDAQ (on which the Class A Ordinary Shares are listed), or on a foreign exchange or market that the IRS determines has rules sufficient to ensure that the market price represents a legitimate and sound fair market value. Consequently, if the Class A Ordinary Shares continue to be listed on NASDAQ and are regularly traded, we expect that the mark-to-market election would be available to U.S. Holders of the Class A Ordinary Shares. However, there can be no assurance in this regard. Further, because a mark-to-market election cannot technically be made for equity interests in any lower-tier PFICs that we own, a U.S. Holder may continue to be subject to the PFIC rules with respect to its indirect interest in any investments held by us that are treated as an equity interest in a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a mark-to-market election with respect to the Class A Ordinary Shares under their particular circumstances.

A U.S. Holder that owns (or is deemed to own) shares in a PFIC during any taxable year of the U.S. Holder, may have to file an IRS Form 8621 and such other information as may be required by the U.S. Treasury Department.

The rules dealing with PFICs are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those described above. Accordingly, U.S. Holders of Securities should consult their tax advisors concerning the reporting requirements that may apply and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding and disposing of Securities if we are treated as a PFIC, including the possibility of making a mark-to-market election and the unavailability of the QEF election.

## Cayman Islands Tax Considerations

The following summary contains a description of certain Cayman Islands income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of ordinary shares, but it does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase ordinary shares. The summary is based upon the tax laws of Cayman Islands and regulations thereunder as of the date hereof, which are subject to change.

Prospective investors should consult their professional advisers on the possible tax consequences of buying, holding or selling any shares under the laws of their country of citizenship, residence or domicile.

## Table of Contents

The following is a discussion on certain Cayman Islands income tax consequences of an investment in our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants (the 'Securities'). The discussion is a general summary of present law, which is subject to prospective and retroactive change. It is not intended as tax advice, does not consider any investor's particular circumstances, and does not consider tax consequences other than those arising under Cayman Islands law.

## Under Existing Cayman Islands Laws:

Payments of dividends and capital in respect of the Securities will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands and no withholding will be required on the payment of interest and principal or a dividend or capital to any holder of Class A Ordinary Shares, as the case may be, nor will gains derived from the disposal of the Class A Ordinary Shares be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporation tax. The Cayman Islands currently have no income, corporation or capital gains tax and no estate duty, inheritance tax or gift tax.

No stamp duty is payable in respect of the issue of Securities or on an instrument of transfer in respect of a Security.

We have been incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability and, as such, has obtained undertakings from the Governor in Cabinet of the Cayman Islands in the following form:

## The Tax Concessions Law

## Undertaking as to Tax Concessions

In accordance with section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (Revised) of the Cayman Islands, the Governor in Cabinet of the Cayman Islands has undertaken with GHL that:

- (a) no law which is thereafter enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to GHL or its operations; and
- (b) in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable:
- (i) on or in respect of the shares, debentures or other obligations of GHL; or
- (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of any relevant payment as defined in the Tax Concessions Act.

The concessions apply for a period of THIRTY years from May 13, 2021.

The Cayman Islands currently levy no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciations and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to be material to GHL levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands save certain stamp duties which may be applicable, from time to time, on certain instruments executed in or brought within the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands.

## Table of Contents

## H. Documents on Display

We are subject to certain of the informational filing requirements of the Exchange Act. Since we are a 'foreign private issuer,' we are exempt from the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act prescribing the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and our officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and 'short-swing' profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act, with respect to their purchase and sale of our shares. In addition, we are not required to file reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. However, we are required to file with the SEC an Annual Report on Form 20-F containing financial statements audited by an independent accounting firm. We may, but are not required, to furnish to the SEC, on Form 6-K, unaudited financial information after each of our first three fiscal quarters. Reports and other information that we file with or furnish electronically with the SEC are accessible via the SEC's website at www.sec.gov .

## ITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include credit risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. See Note 26 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details.

## Credit Risk

We are exposed to credit risk from our operating activities and from our financing activities, which arises principally from our trade receivables, loans and advances to customers, deposits and cash and cash equivalents. With respect to trade receivables, we are not exposed to a major default risk from a single customer, and we actively monitor and manage credit risk and optimizing the payment process. With respect to our loans and advances to customers, our credit risk mainly pertains to term loans provided to borrowers. We closely monitor credit quality for the loans and advances to manage and evaluate our related exposure to credit risk, and such efforts begin with initial underwriting and continue through to full repayment of a loan or advance. We have developed risk models using detailed information from internal historical experience, including customers' prior repayment histories with us, to assess customer requests for a loan or advance. We also use delinquency status and trends to assist in making new and ongoing credit decisions, adjust models and plan collection practices and strategies. With respect to our financial instruments, our deposits and cash and cash equivalents are all held with reputable bank and financial institution counterparties.

## Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to foreign exchange risk on transactional foreign currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales, purchases, receivables, cash and cash equivalents and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of our entities, including Singapore Dollars, Indonesian Rupiah, Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Vietnamese Dong and Philippine Pesos, among other currencies. The functional currencies of our entities are primarily the currency of the country in which the entity operates. The currencies in which these transactions primarily are denominated are also in the currency in which the entity operates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported income and loss from our international businesses included in our consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. A continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our international businesses included in our consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

Interest on external borrowings is denominated in the currency of the borrowing. Our entities' external borrowings are generally denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations, which is also the currency of the country in which the entity operates.

## Table of Contents

Based on the above, we do not believe we are exposed to significant currency transactional foreign currency risk. We may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the impact hedging activities would have on our results of operations.

## Translation Exposure

We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities into U.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

## Interest Rate Risk

Our main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings with variable rates, which expose us to cash flow interest rate risk. Our borrowings at variable rate are mainly denominated in Singapore Dollars, Malaysian Ringgit, Indonesian Rupiah and Thai Baht. The borrowings are periodically contractually repriced and to that extent are also exposed to the risk of future changes in market interest rates. The risk of future changes in market interest rates with regard to variable rate pricing is currently managed via our cash management operations. We intend to reduce gross borrowing balances with excess available cash and minimize exposure to interest rate changes with regard to the borrowings. We manage the deleveraging measures by continuously monitoring the macroeconomic environment and its liquidity position to ensure sufficient funding in meeting our business needs and financial obligations, as well as capital allocation and growth objectives, throughout business cycles.

For the Term Loan B, which we fully repaid in March 2024, a 100 basis point increase in SOFR would have increased consolidated losses by approximately $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

## Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

## Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

## Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes to our internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

## ITEM 16E. PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE ISSUER AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS

Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $500 million worth of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares. The proposed repurchases may be made from time to time through open market transactions at prevailing market prices, privately negotiated transactions, block trades and/or through other legally permissible means, or any combination thereof, depending on market conditions and the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares, among other factors, and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. Our board of directors will review the share repurchase program periodically, and may amend the terms and size of the program. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of Class A ordinary shares.

The table below summarizes our repurchases in 2024. Other than the repurchase in March 2024, which was conducted through a block trade, all the repurchases were made through open market transactions.

## ITEM 16F. CHANGE IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT

Not applicable.

## ITEM 16G. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

We are a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands and are listed on NASDAQ. NASDAQ market rules permit a foreign private issuer like us to follow the corporate governance practices of our home country. Certain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is our home country, may differ significantly from NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards applicable to domestic U.S. companies.

Among other things, we are not required to have: (i) a majority-independent board of directors; (ii) a compensation committee consisting of independent directors; (iii) a nominating committee consisting of independent directors; or (iv) regularly scheduled executive sessions with only independent directors each year. In addition, we are not required to have our shareholders approve certain issuances of securities, including those in connection with the establishment of or material amendments to equity compensation plans or arrangements.

Although not required and as may be changed from time to time, we have a majority-independent board of directors, a majority-independent compensation committee and a nominating committee. Subject to the foregoing, we rely on the exemptions listed above. As a result, you may not be provided with the benefits of certain corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ applicable to U.S. domestic public companies.

Our insider trading policy is filed as Exhibit 11.1 to this annual report..

## ITEM 16K. CYBERSECURITY

## Risk Management and Strategy

We maintain a cyber risk management program to identify, assess, manage, mitigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats. This program is a critical component of our overall risk management program as we recognize that cybersecurity risks may have significant operational, financial, and reputational impacts on us. We have adopted an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process where our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our risk management efforts. Our cybersecurity team is tasked with (i) establishing cybersecurity policies and frameworks, as well as defining roles and responsibilities and setting goals to implement such policies and frameworks; (ii) identifying and alerting respective business and functional units of emerging cybersecurity issues and changing regulatory and risk scenarios; (iii) facilitating and monitoring the implementation of effective cybersecurity risk management practices by business and functional units; (iv) providing guidance and training on specialized aspects of risk management to relevant business and functional units; and (v) sharing relevant risk information with our ERM team. We have also developed and integrated certain mitigation measures and programs into our overall risk management framework, including robust security protocols, regular system updates, employee training, and incident response plans.

Our cybersecurity policies and frameworks, which we review on a yearly basis, are designed to address the relevant laws and regulatory oversight of the countries in which we operate. Recognizing the complexity and evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, cybersecurity risks related to our business and technical operations are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach that includes third-party assessments, internal information technology (IT) audits, and internal IT security compliance reviews, which are then subject to internal and external audits. We also share and receive threat intelligence from government agencies, information sharing and analysis centers, and cybersecurity associations. We assess potential cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in terms of their likelihood and potential impact. To make such assessments, our ERM team and cybersecurity team closely collaborate with our data privacy, IT, operations, legal, and finance teams.

We rely significantly on our third-party service providers, joint ventures, and other partners to maintain our platform. Therefore, cybersecurity incident at a third-party service provider or partner could materially adversely impact us, as well as driver-partners, merchant-partners, and users of our platform. We assess the cybersecurity controls of our third-party service providers and partners through a cybersecurity questionnaire and contractually require these providers and partners to adhere to certain cybersecurity and data privacy standards. We also require our third-party service providers and partners to promptly report their cybersecurity incidents to us so that we can assess the impact of such incidents on us. Additionally, we conduct a periodic reassessment based on the risk profiles of our third-party service providers and partners to strengthen our security posture.

We have, from time to time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks. Although such risks have not materially affected us, and despite our proactive and extensive efforts to manage cybersecurity risks, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us. For more information about the cybersecurity risks we face, refer to 'Item 3. Key Information-D. Risk Factors' (and in particular the risk factors headed 'Security, privacy, or data breaches involving sensitive, personal or confidential information could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions, decrease trust in our platform, and increase the risk of litigation and governmental investigation' and 'The proper uninterrupted functioning of our highly complex technology platform is essential to our business').

## Table of Contents

## Governance

Our board of directors, assisted by the Audit Committee, oversees the management of our cybersecurity risk. The Audit Committee, in particular, receives regular briefings-typically every quarter-from our management on our cybersecurity and information security posture, top cybersecurity risks, and the progress of cybersecurity risk reduction initiatives. At the management level, our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, head of Cybersecurity, and General Counsel are primarily responsible for assessing and managing material cybersecurity risks and incidents. They meet regularly to review cybersecurity performance metrics, identify top cybersecurity risks, and evaluate the status of cybersecurity projects and initiatives.

Our cybersecurity team conducts periodic structured risk and compliance assessments based on a prioritized scope of cybersecurity policies and mandates from regulatory bodies, as well as ad-hoc assessments for risk acceptance requests. The assessments and results are documented with a risk register and then reported to the Audit Committee.

Two members of our board of directors have served as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and/or board member at other companies and have experience overseeing or being involved in cybersecurity risk management. The current head of Cybersecurity is a highly experienced senior member of the existing Cybersecurity management team, possessing over 15 years of expertise in leading teams focused on cybersecurity risk management, application security, and the development of comprehensive cybersecurity strategies. Our Chief Technology Officer has served in various roles on our technology team since 2012 and is therefore familiar with the cybersecurity risks that we face and the necessary safeguards that we must implement in response.

Grab Holdings Limited:

## Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Grab Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years  in  the  three-year  period  ended  December  31,  2024,  and  the  related  notes  (collectively,  the  consolidated  financial  statements).  In  our  opinion,  the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results  of  its  operations  and  its  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  years  in  the  three-year  period  ended  December  31,  2024,  in  conformity  with  IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS Accounting Standards).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2024,  based  on  criteria  established  in Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013) issued  by  the Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission,  and  our  report  dated  March  14,  2025  expressed  an  unqualified  opinion  on  the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

## Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Sufficiency of audit evidence over the IT systems used in the revenue recognition process

As discussed in Notes 4.11 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generated $2,797 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 of which $2,540 million related to the deliveries and mobility segments.

We identified the evaluation of sufficiency of audit evidence over the information technology (IT) systems used in revenue recognition related to the deliveries and mobility segments as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence required subjective auditor judgment due to the complexity and high number of IT systems used in the revenue recognition process related to the deliveries and mobility segments and the specialized skills and knowledge needed to test the IT systems.

## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

## Table of Contents

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to  be  performed  over  the  IT  systems  used  in  the  revenue  recognition  process  related  to  the  deliveries  and  mobility  segments. We  involved  IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:

- · gaining an understanding of the IT systems used in the Company's recognition of revenue
- · evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the IT systems used in the revenue recognition process. This included certain general IT controls and IT application controls used by the Company in its revenue recognition process.

For a sample of transactions, we:

- · recalculated the amount of revenue recognized in the period based on the contractual arrangements with customers and evaluated the consistency of revenue recognition with the Company's accounting policies
- · compared the recorded amounts with underlying support, including cash receipts and statements issued to customers.

We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of such evidence.

Grab Holdings Limited:

## Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Grab Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the  consolidated statements  of  financial  position  of  the  Company  as  of  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  the  related  consolidated  statements  of  profit  or  loss  and  other comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year  period  ended  December  31,  2024,  and  the  related  notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

## Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying Management's Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  Financial  Reporting .  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## Notes to the consolidated financial statements

These notes form an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.

These consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Chief Executive Officer on March 14, 2025.

## 1.                Domicile and activities

Grab Holdings Limited (the 'Company' or 'GHL'), is domiciled in the Cayman Islands. The address of the Company's registered office is at Harbour Place, 2nd Floor, 103 South Church Street, P.O. Box 472, George Town, KYI-1106, Cayman Islands. The principal executive office of the Company is 3 Media Close, #01-03/06, Singapore 138498.

The Company was formed to facilitate the public listing (on the Nasdaq Stock Market ("NASDAQ") and additional capitalization of Grab Holdings Inc. ('GHI') and its subsidiaries (together referred to as 'GHI Group') in December 2021.

The GHI Group enables access to deliveries, mobility, financial services and other offerings in Southeast Asia through its mobile applications (the 'Grab Platform').

These consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 'Group' and individually as 'Group entities') and the Group's interest in equity-accounted investees.

## 2.                  Going concern

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will be able to discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of business.

The assets of the Group exceed its liabilities by $6,351 million as at December 31, 2024 and the Group has incurred a net loss after tax of $158 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.

As at December 31, 2024, the Group has current deposits with banks and financial institutions, debt investments and cash and cash equivalents of $5,382 million available. Based on these factors and in consideration of the Group's business plans, budgets and forecasts, management has a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

## 3.                  Basis of preparation

## 3.1.               Statement of compliance

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS Accounting Standards). Details of the Group's accounting policies, including changes thereto, are included in Notes 3.5 and 4.

## 3.2.               Basis of measurement

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except as otherwise indicated in the accounting policies.

## 3.3.               Functional and presentation currency

These consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars ($), which is the Company's functional currency. All information presented in $ have been rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise stated.

## Table of Contents

## 3.4.               Use of estimates and judgments

In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.

Information about critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes:

- · Notes 4.11 and 20 - Revenue recognition: principal vs. agent considerations and customer identification

Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year are included in the following notes:

- · Note 6 - Impairment test of intangible assets and goodwill: key assumptions underlying recoverable amounts;
- · Notes 4.4(i) and 26 - Measurement of expected credit losses ('ECL') for financial assets;
- · Notes 15 and 29 - Recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies: key assumptions about the likelihood and magnitude of an outflow of resources; and
- · Note 18 - recognition of deferred tax assets: availability of future taxable profit against which deductible temporary differences and tax losses carried forward can be utilized.

## Measurement of fair values

A number of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

As part of an established control framework, significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments are regularly reviewed. If third-party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, such information is assessed to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of the IFRS Accounting Standards, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should be classified. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

- · Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- · Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).
- · Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement (with Level 3 being the lowest).

The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting year during which the change has occurred.

Further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes:

•

Note 6 - Intangible assets and goodwill;

- · Note 19 - Share-based payment arrangements; and
- · Note 26 - Financial instruments.

## Table of Contents

## 3.5.               Change in accounting policies

The Group has applied the following amendments to the IFRS Accounting Standards for the first time for the annual period beginning on 1 January 2024.

- · Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current Liabilities and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1)
- · Supplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7)
- · Lease Liabilities in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16)

The application of these amendments to the IFRS Accounting Standards does not have a material effect on the financial statements.

## 4.                  Material accounting policies

The Group has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all years presented in these consolidated financial statements except as described in Note 3.5, which addresses changes in accounting policies.

## 4.1.               Basis of consolidation

## i)                   Business combinations

The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business and control is transferred to the Group. In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.

The Group has an option to apply a 'concentration test' that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The optional concentration test is met if substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.

The Group measures goodwill at the date of acquisition, considering the following factors:

- · the fair value of the consideration transferred;
- · the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests ('NCI') in the acquiree;
- · if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree, over the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.

The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognized in profit or loss.

Any contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition and included in the consideration transferred. If the contingent consideration that meets the definition of financial instruments is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in profit or loss.

## Table of Contents

When share-based payments awards (replacement awards) are exchanged for awards held by the acquiree's employees (acquiree's awards) and related to past services, then all or a portion of the acquirer's replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This determination is based on the market-based value of the replacement awards compared with the market-based value of the acquiree's awards and the extent to which the replacement awards related to past and/or future service.

NCI that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets in the event of liquidation are measured either at fair value or at the NCI's proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets, at the date of acquisition. The measurement basis taken is elected on a transaction-by-transaction basis. All other NCI are measured at acquisition-date fair value, unless another measurement basis is required by IFRSs.

When the Group enters into a put option agreement with NCI shareholders in an existing subsidiary on their equity interests in that subsidiary, the Group recognizes a liability for the present value of the exercise price of the option that is expected to be settled in cash. If the NCI shareholders have present access to the returns until exercise of the option, the financial liability is recognized separately with a corresponding recognition within equity. Subsequent changes in the measurement of this liability are recognized within equity.

Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Changes in the Group's interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no adjustments are made to goodwill and no gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Adjustments to NCI arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.

## ii)                  Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group. Losses applicable to the NCI in a subsidiary are allocated to the NCI even if doing so causes the NCI to have a deficit balance.

## iii)                 Loss of control

Upon the loss of control, the Group derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any NCI, and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognized in profit or loss. If the Group retains any interest in the former subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost.

## iv)                 Investments in associates and joint ventures (equity-accounted investees)

Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies of these entities. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds 20% or more of the voting power of another entity. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.

Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. They are recognized initially at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income ('OCI') of equity-accounted investees, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases.

## Table of Contents

When the Group's share of losses exceeds its investment in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of the investment, together with any long-term interests that form part thereof, is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to fund the investee's operations or has made payments on behalf of the investee.

## v)                 Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income or expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

## 4.2.               Foreign currency

## i)                   Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the exchange rates at the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency differences are recognized in profit or loss and presented within finance costs.

Foreign currency differences arising from the translation of investment in equity securities designated as fair value to other comprehensive income ('FVOCI') are recognized in OCI.

## ii)                  Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to United States dollars at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to United States dollars at average exchange rates.

Foreign currency differences are recognized in OCI and presented in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to NCI. When a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI. When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.

When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item that are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognized in OCI and are presented in the translation reserve in equity.

## 4.3.               Financial instruments

## i)                   Recognition and initial measurement

Trade receivables are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

## Table of Contents

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL'), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.

## ii)                  Classification and subsequent measurement

## a) Financial assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortized cost; FVOCI - debt investment; FVOCI - equity investment; or FVTPL.

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting year following the change in the business model.

A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- · it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- · its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- · it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- · its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held-for-trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment by investment basis.

All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

## Financial assets - Business model assessment

The Group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:

- · the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. These include whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realizing cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- · how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management;
- · the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed;
- · how managers of the business are compensated - e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and

## Table of Contents

- · the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior years, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity.

Transfer of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Group's continuing recognition of the assets.

Financial assets that are held-for-trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.

## Financial assets - Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest

For the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the Group considers:

- · contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;
- · terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features;
- · prepayment and extension features; and
- · terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features).

A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.

## Financial assets - Subsequent measurement and gains and losses

## Financial assets at FVTPL

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss.

## Financial assets at amortized cost

These assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in profit or loss.

## Debt investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.

## Table of Contents

## Equity investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss.

## b) Financial liabilities - Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses

Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as heldfor-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL, which include warrant liabilities, are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss. Directly attributable transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss. These financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, and trade and other payables.

## iii)                 Derecognition

## a) Financial assets

The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

Where the Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets are not derecognized.

## b) Financial liabilities

The Group derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or canceled or expire. The Group also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any noncash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss.

## iv)                 Offsetting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

## v)                  Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value and are used by the Group in the management of its short-term commitments. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included in cash and cash equivalents.

## Table of Contents

## vi)                 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.

## vii)                Warrants

Share purchase warrants issued by the Group are accounted for as derivative liabilities. The warrants are initially recognized at fair value, and in subsequent periods measured at fair value through profit or loss with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss until the warrants are exercised, redeemed, or expire.

## 4.4.               Impairment

## i)                   Non-derivative financial assets

The Group recognizes loss allowances for expected credit loss on financial assets measured at amortized cost.

Loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases:

- · 12-month Expected Credit Losses or "ECLs": these are ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or for a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months); or
- · Lifetime ECLs: these are ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument or contract asset.

## Simplified approach

The Group applies the simplified approach to provide for ECLs for all trade receivables. The simplified approach requires the loss allowance to be measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.

## General approach

The Group applies the general approach to provide for ECLs on all other financial instruments. Under the general approach, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs at initial recognition.

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. When credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment and includes forward-looking information.

If credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition or if the credit quality of the financial instruments improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs.

The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:

- · the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realizing security (if any is held); or
- · the financial asset is more than 90 days past due (more than 120 days past due for trade receivables).

## Table of Contents

## Measurement of ECLs

ECLs are probability-weighted estimates of credit losses. Credit losses are measured at the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e., the difference between the cash flows due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.

## Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt investments at FVOCI are 'credit-impaired'. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- · significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- · a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due (more than 120 days past due for trade receivables);
- · the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;
- · it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or another financial reorganization; or
- · the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

Presentation of allowance for ECLs in the statement of financial position

Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.

## Write-off

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due.

## ii)                  Non-financial assets

The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, are tested annually for impairment and the recoverable amount is estimated each year.

An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit ('CGU') exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

## Table of Contents

The Group's corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilized by more than one CGU. Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which the corporate asset is allocated.

Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognized in prior years are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.

Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate is not recognized separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an associate is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate may be impaired.

## 4.5.               Property, plant and equipment

## i)                   Recognition and measurement

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes:

- · any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use; and
- · when the Group has an obligation to remove the asset or restore the site, an estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located.

Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of that equipment.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

The gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in profit or loss and presented within other expenses.

## ii)                  Subsequent costs

The cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced component is derecognized. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognized in profit or loss as incurred and presented within cost of revenue and general and administrative expenses.

## iii)                 Depreciation

Depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Significant components of individual assets are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, that component is depreciated separately.

## Table of Contents

Depreciation is recognized as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property, plant and equipment, unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset.

Depreciation is recognized from the date that the property, plant and equipment is installed and are ready for use, or in respect of internally constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are as follows:

• Computers

2 - 3 years

• Building and renovation

3 - 5 years

• Motor vehicles

5 - 7 years

• Office and other equipment

4 - 5 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting year and adjusted if appropriate.

## 4.6.               Intangible assets and goodwill

## i)                   Recognition and measurement

## a) Goodwill

Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and an impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any assets, including goodwill, that form part of the carrying amount of the associates.

## b) Research and development

Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditure is capitalized only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. The expenditure capitalized includes the cost of material, direct labor and overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use. Other development expenditures are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

Capitalized development expenditures are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.

## c) Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets, including a trademark, non-compete agreement and agent networks, that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. The non-compete agreement prohibits the counterparty from competing with Grab in multiple business verticals within Southeast Asia, including the ride-sharing industry.

## ii)                  Subsequent expenditure

Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognized in profit or loss as incurred and presented within general and administrative expenses.

## Table of Contents

## iii)                 Amortization

Amortization is calculated based on the cost of the asset, less its residual value.

Amortization is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than the non-compete agreement and goodwill, from the date that they are available for use. For the non-compete agreement, amortization was recognized based on a diminishing balance method that reflected the pattern in which future economic benefits arising from the non-compete agreement were expected to be consumed by the Group.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are as follows:

• Trademark

13 years

• Non-compete agreement

4 years

• Other intangible assets

3 years

Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting year and adjusted if appropriate.

## 4.7.               Leases

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

## i)                   As a lessee

At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices. The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

- · fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
- · variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;

## Table of Contents

- · amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
- · the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

The Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in 'property, plant and equipment' and lease liabilities in 'loans and borrowings' in the statement of financial position.

## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Group has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases. The Group recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

## ii)                  As a lessor

At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative standalone prices.

When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.

To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, then the Group applies IFRS 15 to allocate the consideration in the contract.

The Group applies the derecognition and impairment requirements in IFRS 9 to the net investment in the lease. The Group further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in the lease.

The Group leases motor vehicles to driver-partners who typically use the vehicles to provide transport and delivery services through Grab Platform. The Group recognizes lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term as part of 'Revenue'. Rental income from lease of motor vehicles is presented as a part of 'Mobility revenue (see Note 4.11(i))'.

## Table of Contents

## 4.8.               Inventories

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out or weighted average allocation methods depending on the nature of inventory, and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition.

Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

## 4.9.               Employee benefits

## i)                   Defined contribution plans

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the years during which related services are rendered by employees.

## ii)                  Defined benefits plans

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefits plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the year by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined liability (asset).

The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations and that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.

The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply to any plan in the Group. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.

Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest). The Group recognizes them immediately in OCI and all expenses related to defined benefit plans in employee benefits expense in profit or loss. When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed benefit related to past service by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs.

The Group recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. The gain or loss on settlement is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation being settled as determined on the date of settlement and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments made directly by the Group in connection with the settlement.

## iii)                 Short-term employee benefits

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Table of Contents

## iv)                 Employee leave entitlement

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognized when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the reporting date.

## v)                  Share-based payment transactions

The grant date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment awards granted to employee is recognized as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the sharebased payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.

When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognized is the grant date fair value of the unmodified award, provided the original vesting terms of the award are met. An additional expense, measured as at the date of modification, is recognized for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee. Where an award is canceled by the entity or by the counterparty, any remaining element of the fair value of the award is expensed immediately through profit or loss.

## 4.10.              Provisions

A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognized as a finance cost.

Provisions for dismantlement, removal and restoration are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amounts have been reliably estimated.

The Group recognizes the estimated costs of dismantlement, removal or restoration of items of property, plant and equipment arising from the acquisition or use of assets. This provision is estimated based on the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, taking into consideration time value.

Changes in the estimated timing or amount of the expenditure or discount rate for asset dismantlement, removal and restoration costs are adjusted against the cost of the related property, plant and equipment, unless the decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the assets or the asset has reached the end of its useful life. In such cases, the excess of the decrease over the carrying amount of the asset or the changes in the liability is recognized in profit or loss immediately.

## 4.11.              Revenue

The Group recognizes revenue as or when it satisfies its service obligations. The Group earns revenue predominantly from the following services:

## Table of Contents

## i)                   Revenue by segment

## a) Deliveries

Fees earned from driver-partners, merchant-partners and consumers for connecting driver-partners and merchant-partners with consumers to facilitate delivery of a variety of daily necessities, including ready-to-eat meals and groceries, as well as point-to-point parcel delivery. Deliveries revenue also includes delivery fees charged to consumers in certain markets where the Group is responsible for delivery services, income earned from the sale of a variety of daily necessities through the operation of a chain of physical stores in certain markets, and advertising revenue arising from promoted listings and banner advertisements, enabling merchant-partners to promote their businesses on the Grab platform.

## b) Mobility

Fees earned from driver-partners and consumers for connecting consumers with transportation rides provided by driver-partners across a variety of multi-modal mobility options, and advertising revenue arising from online and offline advertising solutions which include in-car product placements and mobile billboards. Mobility revenue also includes rental income from the leasing of motor vehicles to driver-partners, who typically use the vehicles to offer services through the Grab Platform (see 4.7(ii) for lease accounting as a lessor).

## Deliveries and Mobility: principal vs. agent considerations and related revenue recognition

The Group enters into service agreements with driver-partners and merchant-partners to use the Grab Platform. A contract exists between the Group and the driver-partners and merchant-partners once they accept a transaction request and their ability to cancel the transaction lapses. The Group evaluates the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether it acts as a principal by controlling the service provided to the consumer, or whether it acts as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the consumer.

The Group predominantly facilitates the provision of the service by driver-partners and merchant-partners to consumers, for the driver-partners and merchant-partners to fulfill their contractual promise to the consumers. The driver-partners and merchant-partners fulfill their promise to provide a service to their customer through use of the Grab Platform. While in these agreements the Group facilitates setting the price for services, the driver-partners and consumers have the discretion in accepting the transaction price through the Grab Platform. In these agreements, the Group is not responsible for fulfilling the services being provided to the consumer nor does the Group have inventory risk related to these services. With regard to these agreements, the Group has concluded that the Group is acting as an agent to facilitate the successful completion of delivery and transportation services by the driver-partners and merchant-partners to consumers.

In enabling connection in these agreements, the driver-partners, merchant-partners and consumers are considered the Group's customers; with the Group having a separate performance obligation to each:

- · the driver-partners (to connect the drive-partners with consumers to facilitate and successfully complete transportation and delivery services),
- · the merchant-partners (to connect the merchant-partners with consumers to facilitate and successfully complete ordering services); and
- · the consumer (to connect the consumer with driver-partners and merchant-partners).

The Group recognizes fees on the completion of a successful transportation or delivery service by driver-partners and merchant-partners. With regard to these agreements, the Group recognizes revenue on a net basis, reflecting the fees owed to the Group from the driver-partners, merchant-partners and consumers as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from consumers.

## Table of Contents

In certain markets, the Group is responsible for delivery services to consumers and separately subcontracts with driver-partners or third-party couriers to perform the delivery on behalf of the Group. With regard to these agreements, the Group is the principal controlling the delivery services to consumers and therefore recognizes the delivery fees charged to consumers as revenue, with payments to driver-partners or third-party couriers recognized in 'Cost of revenue' (see Note 4.12).

## c) Financial services

Financial services revenue predominantly comprises:

- · interest earned on loans and advances provided to merchant-partners, driver-partners and consumers, interest earned on unsecured retail loans and investment securities through the digital banking business (see Note 4.3(ii) for measurement of financial assets at amortized cost), insurance distribution offerings, and associated advertising revenue.
- · fees earned from digital payment processing services charged to merchant-partners primarily based on the net value payments successfully completed through the Grab platform. Transaction fee revenue resulting from a payment processing transaction is recognized once the transaction is complete.

## d) Others

A combination of multiple operating businesses that are not individually material. They include mapping services and anti-fraud offerings. Revenue is recognized once the obligation to provide the service is satisfied.

## ii)                  Incentives to customers

The Group evaluates the presentation of the incentives paid to customers based on whether the Group receives a separate identifiable benefit from the respective customer. The Group has concluded that it does not receive distinct goods or services from the respective customer and the incentives are therefore recorded as a reduction from fees received from the respective customer. To the extent that such incentives exceed the amount of fees received from the respective customer, the excess is recorded as negative revenue. For loyalty rewards offered to customers as part of revenue transactions, the Group defers a portion of the revenue based on the estimated standalone selling price of the loyalty rewards earned and recognizes the revenue as they are redeemed in future transactions or when the rewards expire.

## 4.12.              Expenses

The main components of the Group's expenses by functions are as follows:

- i) Cost of revenue comprises expenses directly or indirectly attributable to the Group's Deliveries, Mobility, Financial Services and other offerings (see Note 4.11) and primarily consists of data management and platform related technology costs including amortization of technology and market activity related intangible assets, carrying amount of inventories of our supermarket operations, payments to driver-partners where the Group is responsible for delivery services to consumers (see Note 4.11), compensation costs (including share-based compensation) for operations and support personnel, payment processing fees, costs incurred in relation to its motor vehicle fleet used for rental services including depreciation and impairment; and an allocation of associated corporate costs such as depreciation of right-of-use assets.
- ii) Sales and marketing primarily consist of marketing and advertising costs, compensation costs (including share-based compensation) to sales and marketing employees and an allocation of associated corporate costs such as depreciation of right-ofuse assets.
- iii) Research and development expenses primarily consist of compensation cost (including share-based compensation) to engineering, design, product development and data analytics employees, and allocation of associated corporate costs such as depreciation of right-of-use assets.

## Table of Contents

- iv) General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs (including share-based compensation) for executive management and administrative personnel (including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, public affairs, corporate IT, corporate security and general administration employees), occupancy and facility costs, administrative fees, professional service fees, depreciation on certain administration assets, legal settlement accrual and allocation of associated corporate costs such as depreciation of right-of-use assets.

## 4.13.              Finance income and finance costs

The Group's net finance income or costs include:

- · interest income;
- · interest expense;
- · the net gain or loss on financial instruments at FVTPL;
- · the foreign currency gain or loss on financial assets and financial liabilities;
- · the gain or loss on modification of financial liabilities; and
- · the unwinding of the discount on provisions.

Interest income or expense is recognized using the effective interest method.

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:

- · the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or
- · the amortized cost of the financial liability.

In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortized cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.

Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.

## 4.14.              Related parties

For the purposes of these consolidated financial statements, parties are considered to be related to the Group if the Group has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the party or exercise significant influence over the party in making financial and operating decisions, or vice versa, or where the Group and the party are subject to common control or common significant influence. Related parties may be individuals or other entities.

## 4.15.              Income tax

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that they relate to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in OCI.

The Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

## Table of Contents

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for:

- · temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
- · temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- · taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

The measurement of deferred taxes reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future taxable profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of taxable temporary differences is insufficient to recognize a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted for reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on the business plans for individual subsidiaries in the Group. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.

Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.

In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for income tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes the Group to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact income tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.

The Group has determined that the global minimum top-up tax - which it is required to pay under Pillar Two legislation - is an income tax in the scope of IAS 12. The Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred.

## Table of Contents

## 4.16.              Loss per share

The Group presents basic and diluted loss per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted loss per share is calculated by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive ordinary shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding share options, restricted share units ('RSUs'), warrants and is reflected in diluted loss per ordinary share by application of the treasury stock method.

## 4.17.              Segment reporting

An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group's other components. The operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group's chief executive officer (the Chief Operating Decision Maker or 'CODM') to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. Segment results that are reported to the Group's CODM include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate assets, head office expenses, and tax assets and liabilities.

## 4.18.              Standards issued but not yet effective

A number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2024 and earlier application is permitted. However, the Group has not early adopted these new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements, the expected implications of which are summarized below:

## A. IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements

IFRS 18 will replace IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and applies for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027. The new standard introduces the following key new requirements.

- · Entities are required to classify all income and expenses into five categories in the statement of profit or loss, namely the operating, investing, financing, discontinued operations and income tax categories. Entities are also required to present a newlydefined operating profit subtotal. Entities' net profit will not change.
- · Management-defined performance measures (MPMs) are disclosed in a single note in the financial statements
- · Enhanced guidance is provided on how to group information in the financial statements.

In addition, all entities are required to use the operating profit subtotal as the starting point for the statement of cash flows when presenting operating cash flows under the indirect method.

The Group is still in the process of assessing the impact of the new standard, particularly with respect to the structure of the Group's statement of profit or loss, the statement of cash flows and the additional disclosures required for MPMs.

## B. Other accounting standards

The following new and amended IFRS Accounting Standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.

- · Lack of Exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21)
- · Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments (Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7)
- · Annual Improvements to IFRS Accounting Standards Volume 11

## a) Southeast Asia ride hailing cash generating units ('Southeast Asia Ride Hailing CGUs')

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill of $606 million has been allocated to the Group's ride hailing business operations across countries in Southeast Asia, each of which is considered a CGU ('Ride Hailing CGU'). The goodwill has been allocated in proportion to the noncompete benefits attributable to each Ride Hailing CGU. These benefits are represented by the fair value of the non-compete agreement on initial recognition attributable to each Ride Hailing CGU, which was based on a valuation technique that reflected the present value of differential cash flows between 'with' and 'without' non-compete agreement scenarios.

For the financial years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the estimated recoverable amount of each Ride Hailing CGU has exceeded its carrying amount and therefore no impairment loss was recognized.

The recoverable amount of the Ride Hailing CGUs was based on fair value less cost of disposal. To arrive at the fair value less cost of disposal, the Group applied a revenue based multiple of 2.0 from comparable companies to the amount of revenue plus consumer incentives of each Ride Hailing CGUs (2023: revenue based multiple of 2.5 derived from comparable companies to the amount of revenue plus consumer incentives of each Ride Hailing CGUs). The fair value measurement is categorized as a level 3 fair value (2023: level 3 fair value) based on the inputs in the valuation technique used (see Note 3.4). It has been identified that only changes beyond reasonably possible levels of the revenue based multiple could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.

## b) Malaysia delivery and offering of daily necessities cash generating unit ('Malaysia Mart CGU')

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill of $163 million has been allocated to the Group's goods ordering and delivery booking services in Malaysia ("Malaysia Mart CGU").

For the financial years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the estimated recoverable amount of the Malaysia Mart CGU exceeded its carrying amount and therefore no impairment loss was recognized.

The recoverable amount of the Malaysia Mart CGU was based on fair value less cost of disposal. To arrive at the fair value less cost of disposal, the Group applied an earnings based multiple of 11.6 derived from comparable companies to the earnings of its Malaysia Mart CGU (2023: earnings based multiple of 13.3 derived from comparable companies to the earnings of its Malaysia Mart CGU). The fair value measurement is categorized as a level 3 fair value (2023: level 3 fair value) based on the inputs in the valuation technique used (see Note 3.4). It has been identified that only changes beyond reasonably possible levels of the earnings based multiple could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.

## c) Indonesia mobile payments and rewards cash generating unit ('Indonesia Payment CGU')

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill of $34 million has been allocated to the Group's Indonesia Payment CGU.

For the financial years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the estimated recoverable amount of the Indonesia Payment CGU exceeded its carrying amount and therefore no impairment loss was recognized.

## Table of Contents

The recoverable amount of the Indonesia Payment CGU was based on fair value less cost of disposal. To arrive at the fair value less cost of disposal, the Group applied a revenue based multiple of 2.7 derived from comparable companies to the revenue of its Indonesia Payment CGUs (2023: revenue based multiple of 3.6 derived from comparable companies to the revenue of its Indonesia Payment CGUs). The fair value measurement is categorized as a level 3 fair value (2023: level 3 fair value) based on the inputs in the valuation technique used (see Note 3.4). It has been identified that only changes beyond reasonably possible levels of the revenue based multiple could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.

The Group has borrowings denominated in Singapore Dollars ('SGD'), Malaysian Ringgit ('MYR'), Indonesian Rupiah ('IDR') and Thailand Baht ('THB').

## i)                   Warrant liabilities

These liabilities comprise 26 million warrants that entitles the holder to purchase one GHL Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share. These warrants are exercisable as at December 31, 2024 and will expire on December 1, 2026.

The warrants are listed on NASDAQ under the trading symbol 'GRABW'. Of these 26 million warrants, 12 million warrants can be exercised on a cashless basis by the holder into a variable number of shares based on volume weighted average observable price of the GHL Class A ordinary shares at the time of exercise. All the remaining warrants cannot be exercised cashless, and can be redeemed at GHL's sole discretion at a price of $0.01 or $0.10 per warrant depending on the GHL Class A ordinary shares closing price over an observable trading period at the time of redemption. Following notice of such a redemption, holders of the warrants will have the right to exercise the warrants prior to redemption, including on a cashless basis in certain circumstances.

The terms of all warrants include a provision that in the event of a tender or exchange offer made to and accepted by holders of more than 50% of the outstanding GHL Class A ordinary shares, the warrant holders would be entitled to receive cash for their warrants. Management considers that this feature results in the warrants being classified as liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, as the event is an uncertain future event that is not within the control of the Group; and therefore, the Group does not have an unconditional right to avoid delivering cash.

The warrants have been measured at the trading price. The carrying value of the warrants as at December 31 is as follows:

|                      | 2024   | 2023   |

As these non-controlling shareholders have present access to the returns until exercise of the option, the financial liability arising from the put option is presented within 'Other liabilities" with the corresponding effect within equity under "Other reserves" (see note 12(ii)(c)). Subsequent to initial recognition, changes in the carrying amount of these put liabilities are recognized within equity.

## v)                  Accrued operating expenses

These amounts include $80 million for a settlement agreed on during 2024 with regard to class action lawsuits which were filed against the Company and certain of its officers in 2022.

## iv)               Unrecognized deferred tax assets

Deferred tax assets have not been recognized in respect of the following items:

|                       | 2024   | 2023   |
|-----------------------|--------|--------|
| (in $ millions)       | $      | $      |
| Unutilized tax losses | 4,147  | 5,152  |

Deferred tax assets are recognized in the consolidated financial statements only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilize the benefits. The use of these tax losses is subject to the agreement of the tax authorities and compliance with certain provisions of the tax legislation of the respective countries in which the Group operates.

## v)                  Tax losses carried forward

Out of the $4,147 million (2023: $5,152 million) tax losses, $1,048 million expires between 2025 to 2034 (2023: $2,526 million expires between 2024 to 2033). The remaining tax losses do not expire under the current tax legislation.

Deferred tax assets in certain subsidiaries, have not been recognized in respect of the tax losses carried forward because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group entities can utilize benefits therefrom.

## vi)                 Global minimum top-up tax

During the financial year beginning 1 January 2024, Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The Group has performed an assessment of its exposure arising from Pillar Two legislation based on the most recent financial statements of the constituent entities and there is no current tax impact for the year ended December 31, 2024 .

If the top up tax had applied in 2024 for the countries in which the legislation has been enacted but not yet effective, based on an ongoing assessment, our preliminary conclusion is that the impact to the Group would have been insignificant primarily because the Group entities in most countries are subject to corporate income tax rates of above 15%.

## 19.                 Share-based payment arrangements

## i)                   Description of the share-based payment arrangements

As at December 31, 2024, the Company has in place an equity-settled share-based payment arrangement, the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the '2021 GHL Plan'), under which Company may:

- 1. issue restricted share units/awards ('RSUs'); or
- 2. grant options to purchase its ordinary shares ('Share Options'); or
- 3. issue restricted ordinary shares

to selected employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Group and non-employee directors of the Company.

The RSUs and Share Options granted generally vest 25% on each anniversary of the grant, over a four year-period. Certain RSUs granted vest upon grant date. The maximum term of Share Options granted under the 2021 GHL Plan does not exceed ten years from the date of grant. The RSUs and Share Options granted to employees do not have the rights of the ordinary shares until the RSUs and Share Options are vested, exercised and recorded into the register of shareholders of the Company.

During 2022, the Company established the 2021 Equity Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") which allows eligible employees to contribute, through payroll deductions, up to 15% of their eligible compensation to purchase the Company's Class A Ordinary Shares at a 15% discount of the lower of either (i) the closing trading price of the first day of an offering period or (ii) the closing trading price of the purchase date.

In addition to the above arrangements,

- · the Company has established a Performance Share Unit ("PSU") plan, under which PSUs may be issued to selected employees, officers, directors, consultants and non-employee directors of the Group and of the Company which generally vest based on specified market and non-market performance conditions, and on completion of a specified period of service; and,
- · certain subsidiaries of the Group have also set up certain equity settled share-based payment arrangements for the issuance of restricted share units/awards and share options which generally vest 25% on each anniversary of the grant, over a four yearperiod.

The share-based payment expense in relation to these arrangements are not material to the Group.

## Loan receivables and commitments in the financial services segment

The exposure to credit risk mainly relates to:

- · term loans provided to merchant-partners, driver-partners and consumers; and
- · unsecured retail financing (loans and commitments) provided to individuals through digital banking activity

The Group closely monitors credit quality for these loans and commitments to manage and evaluate the Group's related exposure to credit risk. Credit risk management begins with initial underwriting and continues through to full repayment of a loan. To assess a borrower who requests a loan, the Group, among other indicators, internally developed risk models using detailed information from internal historical experience including the borrower's prior repayment history with the Group as well as other measures including platform behavior. The Group uses delinquency status and trends to assist in making new and ongoing credit decisions, adjust models, plan collection practices and strategies.

## Expected credit loss measurement

The Group uses an allowance matrix to measure ECLs of trade receivables which comprise a large number of small balances.

Loss rates are calculated using a 'roll rate' method based on the probability of a receivable progressing through successive stages of delinquency to write-off. Roll rates are calculated separately for exposures in different segments based on the common credit risk characteristics of geographic region and type of services purchased. Loss rates are based on actual payment and credit loss experience over the preceding 12 to 18 months. These rates are multiplied by scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical data has been collected, current conditions and the Group's view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.

The following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECLs for trade receivables as at December 31:

| At December 31                           | 23     | 22     |

* Amount less than $1 million

## Deposits with banks and financial institutions, debt investments and cash and cash equivalents

At December 31, 2024, the Group held deposits with banks and financial institutions, debt investments (at amortized cost and FVOCI) and cash and cash equivalents of $2,789 million (2023: $2,651 million) and $2,964 million (2023: $3,138 million) respectively. These amounts are held with reputable bank and financial institution counterparties.

Impairment on deposits and debt investments (at amortized cost and FVOCI) with a maturity of 12 months or less from reporting date, and cash and cash equivalents has been measured on the 12-month expected loss basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures. Impairment on deposits and debt investments (FVOCI) with a maturity of more than 12 months from reporting date has been measured on an expected loss basis that reflects the longer maturities of the exposures. These amounts have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties and therefore have insignificant provisions for expected credit losses.

## c) Liquidity risks

Risk management policy

'Liquidity risk' is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's objective when managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.

## Table of Contents

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group's cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows. This is generally carried out by operating companies of the Group in accordance with practice and limits set by the Group. These limits vary by location to take into account the liquidity of the market in which the entity operates. In addition, the Group's liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows in major currencies and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.

The Group monitors its liquidity risk and maintains a level of cash and bank balances deemed adequate by management to finance the Group's operations and to mitigate the effects of fluctuation in cash flows.

As part of their overall liquidity management, the Group maintains sufficient levels of funds to meet its working capital requirements.

The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities considered in the context of the Group's liquidity risk management strategy. The amounts are gross and undiscounted and include contractual interest payments.

## d) Market risks

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.

## Table of Contents

## Currency risk

The Group is exposed to transactional foreign currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales, purchases, receivables, cash and cash equivalents and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities. The functional currencies of Group entities are primarily the currency of the country in which the entities operate. The currencies in which these transactions primarily are denominated are also in the currency in which the entities operate. The currencies in which these transactions are primarily denominated are the Singapore Dollar ('SGD'), Malaysian Ringgit ('MYR') and Indonesian Rupiah ('IDR').

Interest on external borrowings is denominated in the currency of the borrowing. The Group entities' external borrowings are generally denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of the Group, which is also the currency of the country in which the entity operates.

In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, including monetary items which do not form part of the net investment in foreign operation, the Group's policy is to ensure that its net exposure is kept at a reasonable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short term imbalances.

Based on the above approach to currency risk management, the Group's net exposure to currencies that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities is insignificant.

## Interest rate risks

As described below, the Group's main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings with variable rates, which expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.

The interest rate profile of the Group's interest-bearing financial instruments is as follows:

|                           | Carrying amount   | Carrying amount   |
|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
|                           | 2024              | 2023              |
| (in $ millions)           | $                 | $                 |
| Fixed-rate instruments    |                   |                   |
| Other investments         | 3,223             | 2,852             |
| Cash and cash equivalents | 2,964             | 3,138             |
| Bank loans                | (158)             | (111)             |
| Variable-rate instruments |                   |                   |
| Bank loans                | (48)              | (44)              |
| Term loan                 | -                 | (476)             |

· For the purpose of comparability, the carrying amount of debt investments measured at FVTPL have been included.

## Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed-rate instruments

Most fixed-rate financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group are not accounted for at FVTPL. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting dates would not materially affect profit or loss.

## Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments

The Group's borrowings at variable rate are mainly denominated in Singapore Dollars, Malaysian Ringgit, Indonesian Rupiah and Thai Baht. The borrowings are periodically contractually repriced and to that extent are also exposed to the risk of future changes in market interest rates. For the bank loans, a change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have had an insignificant impact on profit or loss and equity. In 2023, for the term loan, a 100 basis point increase in SOFR would have increased consolidated losses by approximately $5 million .

## Table of Contents

## ii)                  Offsetting financial instruments

For the purposes of cash flow management, the Group has entered into transactions that have resulted in the recognition of a financial asset and liability of carrying amounts of $694 million and $694 million respectively, that are offset in the statement of financial position as the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts as well as the intention to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

## iii)                 Capital management

The Group's objectives in managing capital are to ensure that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure so as to enable it to execute business plans and to maximize shareholder value. The Group defines 'capital' as including all components of equity and external borrowings.

The capital management strategy translates into the need to ensure that at all times the Group has the liquidity and cash to meet its obligations as they fall due while maintaining a careful balance between equity and debt to finance its assets, day-to-day operations and future growth. Having access to flexible and cost-effective financing allows the Group to respond quickly to opportunities.

The Group's capital structure is reviewed on an ongoing basis with adjustments made in light of changes in economic conditions, regulatory requirements and business strategies affecting the Group. The Group balances its overall capital structure by considering the costs of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. In order to maintain or achieve an optimal capital structure, the Group may issue new shares from time to time, retire or obtain new borrowings or adjust the asset portfolio.

The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy. It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

## v)                 Measurement of fair values

## a) Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs

The following tables show the valuation techniques used in measuring Level 2 and Level 3 fair values for financial instruments in the statement of financial position, as well as the significant unobservable inputs used. The movement in fair value arising from reasonably possible changes to the significant unobservable inputs was assessed as not significant.

* Amount less than $1 million

Assets and liabilities are predominantly reviewed by the CODM at a consolidated level and not at a segment level. Within the Group's noncurrent assets are property, plant and equipment which are primarily located in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Other non-current assets such as intangible assets, goodwill and other investments are predominantly regional assets that are not attributed to a segment.

With effect from January 1, 2024, the Group changed the composition of its operating segments to align with changes in how its businesses are managed and performances evaluated by the CODM. These changes include:

- · operating segments identified as Deliveries , Mobility , Financial services and Others (previously Deliveries, Mobility, Financial services , and Enterprise and new initiatives )
- · revenue from the advertising business previously reported within the Enterprise and new initiatives segment are now reported in the Mobility, Deliveries and Financial services segments in accordance with the respective advertising products;
- · a portion of payment transaction revenues, transaction costs and other relevant support costs previously reported in the Financial services segment that relate to the Mobility and Deliveries transactions now being allocated to these respective segments;
- · selected regional corporate costs that support the Mobility, Deliveries and Financial services segments are now being allocated to these respective segments;
- · realized foreign exchange gains/(losses) are excluded from Segment Adjusted EBITDA, as compared to only unrealized foreign exchange gain (loss) in previous financial reporting periods

## Table of Contents

After these changes, the Group's reportable segments are Deliveries, Mobility, Financial services and Others with the related previously reported segment information recast accordingly. These reporting changes have no impact on previously reported consolidated statements of financial position, statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity or statement of cash flows.

## 28.                 Business combinations

There were no material acquisitions of businesses during the financial years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

## 29.                 Contingencies and commitments

## i)                   Contingencies

The Group is involved in multiple legal proceedings which relate to a range of matters including personal injury or property damage cases, employment or labor-related disputes, contractual disputes with suppliers or commercial partners, disputes with third parties and regulatory inquiries; and also other proceedings relating to compliance with competition, privacy or other applicable regulations, including tax assessments in certain jurisdictions.

As at December 31, 2024, in view of the uncertainty of the outcome of these proceedings, with the exception of certain specific legal claims (see Note 15), provisions for such claims have not been recognized as the Group does not consider these proceedings to result in obligations or in the outflow of resources. These possible obligations include an internal investigation into potential violations of certain anti-corruption laws relating to the Group's operations in one of the countries in which it operates, voluntarily self-reported by the Group to the U.S. Department of Justice during 2020.

## ii)                  Commitments

The Group has entered into non-cancelable contracts which mainly pertain to purchase of data processing and technology platform infrastructure services, the commitments for which are summarized below.

## 30.                 Subsequent events

In March 2025, the Group acquired a 80% ownership interest in Eastern Grocer Sdn. Bhd. ('Everrise'), an operator in the premium grocery segment in Malaysia predominantly in the East Malaysia. Subject to certain terms, the Group will have the option to buy, and the current shareholders will have the option to sell to the Group, the remaining 20% of the ownership interest of Everrise after the closing of the transaction. The consideration for the acquisition of 80% ownership interest is $54 million in cash. The determination of consideration is subject to finalization, as is the resultant accounting.

- (e) The Covered Holder (i) consents to and authorizes the publication and disclosure by the Proxyholder of the Covered Holder's identity and holding of Covered Shares, the nature of the Covered Holder's commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Deed (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of this Deed) and any other information, in each case, that the Proxyholder reasonably determines is required to be disclosed  by  applicable  law  in  any  press  release,  any  Schedule  13D  or  Schedule  13G  or  other  disclosure document filed with the SEC, and any other filings with or notices to Governmental Authorities in connection with  this  Deed  or  any  other  agreement  or  transaction  entered  into  in  connection  herewith,  and  (ii)  agrees promptly to give to the Proxyholder any information it or its agents may reasonably request for the preparation of any such documents. The Covered Holder also agrees to promptly notify the Proxyholder of any required corrections with respect to any information supplied by the Covered Holder for use in any such document, if and to the extent that any such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.

As a condition of transfer of Covered Shares by a Covered Holder to a third party that  is  a  Covered Transferee,  the  Covered  Holder  shall  cause  such  Covered Transferee  to  enter  into  (a)  a  deed  of adherence to this Deed, in the form of the Deed of Adherence attached hereto as Exhibit A, by which such third party shall agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this Deed and agree to assume the obligations and liabilities of such Covered Holder as if he/she/it were named herein as such Covered Holder and (b) a joinder to that certain letter agreement by and among, among others, the Proxyholder and the Exco Member regarding a right of first offer  of  the  Proxyholder  in  respect  of  the  Exco  Member's  Class  B  ordinary  shares  of  the  Company  (the  ' ROFO Agreement ') in form and substance satisfactory to the Proxyholder, and shall deliver a duly executed copy of such documents to the

The  Parties  expressly  acknowledge  and  agree,  among  other  things,  that  the Proxyholder would not have consented to the issuance of Class B Shares to the Covered Holder but for the Proxy granted by the Covered Holder to the Proxyholder. The Company agrees with the Proxyholder that it shall  not  accept,  honor  or  permit  any  Covered  Holder  to  vote,  or  provide  any  consent  with  respect  to,  any Covered Shares with respect to any of the Entrusted Rights.

The Covered Holder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies or powers of attorney with respect to the Covered Shares held by such Covered Holder or over which such Covered Holder has voting power or control and shall not after the date of this Deed, unless and until the Proxy terminates pursuant to Section 4.3 below, purport to grant any other proxy or power of attorney with respect to any of the Covered Shares, deposit any of the Covered Shares into a voting trust or enter into any agreement  (other  than  this  Deed),  arrangement  or  understanding  with  any  person,  directly  or  indirectly,  to vote, grant any proxy or give instructions with respect to the voting of any of the Covered Shares, in each case, with respect to any of the matters set forth herein.

- (d) Validity; Commitment to Vote. The Covered Holder agrees not to challenge the validity or enforceability of this  Section  2.  If  for  whatever  reason  or  no  reason  a  Proxy  is  deemed  invalid,  unlawful  or  otherwise unenforceable, the Covered Holder having, or having purported to, grant such Proxy agrees to vote, or cause to be voted, all Covered Shares held by such Covered Holder, or over which such Covered Holder has voting power or control, from time to time and at all times, in the manner directed by the Proxyholder in respect of all consents or resolutions of the Company.
- 3. Representations And Warranties Of The Parties . Each Party, severally and not jointly, represents and warrants to the other Parties  that  they  have  the  full  legal  capacity,  right  and  authority  to  execute  this  Deed  and  perform  his/her  obligations hereunder.

## 4.10 Remedies.

- (a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if this Deed was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damage. It is accordingly agreed that each Party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including in the form of an injunction or injunctions, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Deed and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Deed in an appropriate arbitration tribunal as set forth in Section 4.7, this being in addition to any other remedy to which any Party is entitled at law, in equity,  in  contract,  in  tort  or  otherwise,  including  money  damages. The  right  to  specific  enforcement  shall include,  by  reason  of  the  Proxyholder's  and  the  Company's  interest  as  described  herein,  the  Proxyholder's right  to  seek  injunctive  relief  to  prevent  the  Covered  Holder  from  exercising  or  purporting  to  exercise  the Entrusted Rights. The Parties further agree (i) to waive any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with any such equitable remedy, (ii) not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement pursuant to this Section 4.10 is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to applicable law or inequitable for any reason and (iii) to waive any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.
- (b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Section 4.10 is an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and without that right, the Parties would not have entered into this Deed.
- (c) In  any  dispute  arising  out  of  or  related  to  this  Deed,  or  any  other  agreement,  document,  instrument  or certificate contemplated  hereby, or any transactions contemplated  hereby or thereby, the applicable adjudicating body shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the

reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in  connection  with  the  dispute  and  the  enforcement  of  its  rights  under  this  Deed  or  any  other  agreement, document, instrument or certificate contemplated hereby and, if the adjudicating body determines a party to be the prevailing party under circumstances where the prevailing party won on some but not all of the claims and counterclaims, the adjudicating body may award the prevailing party an appropriate percentage of the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the adjudication and the enforcement  of  its  rights  under  this  Deed  or  any  other  agreement,  document,  instrument  or  certificate contemplated hereby or thereby.

- 4.11 Certain Fees and Expenses. The Company shall bear and reimburse (i) all fees and expenses that may be incurred in connection with the issuance of Class B Shares to the Covered Holder, the conversion of Class B Shares held by the Covered Holder to Class A Shares, and any transfer of such Class A Shares to the brokerage account(s) held by the Covered Holder; and (ii) reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the Exco Member in obtaining legal advice in connection with the ownership of and the rights pertaining to Class B Shares, provided that (x) such legal advice shall not extend to fees and expenses related to personal tax advice or any other advice of a similar personal nature, and (y) only one set of legal advice is obtained with respect to any matter that has the same or similar implication on the Exco Member and all other members of the Executive Committee who sign voting proxy deeds in the same form as this Deed.
- 4.12 Headings; Counterparts. The headings in this Deed are for convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation of any provision of this Deed. This Deed may be executed in two or more counterparts, and by different Parties in separate counterparts, with the same effect as if all Parties had signed the same  document,  but  all  of  which  together  shall  constitute  one  and  the  same  instrument.  Copies  of  executed counterparts of this Deed transmitted by electronic transmission (including by email or in .pdf format) or facsimile shall have the same legal effect as original signatures and shall be considered original executed counterparts of this Deed.
- 4.13 Mutual Drafting. With regard to each and every term and condition of this Deed, the Parties understand and agree that the same has been mutually negotiated, prepared and drafted, and if at any time the Parties desire or are required to interpret or construe any such term or condition or any agreement or instrument subject hereto, no consideration shall be given to the issue of which Party actually prepared, drafted or requested any term or condition of this Deed.

## GRAB HOLDINGS LIMITED

## STATEMENT OF POLICIES

## GOVERNING MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION AND THE PREVENTION OF INSIDER TRADING

(Initially effective as of November 19, 2021, as amended on August 16, 2023 and December 18, 2024)

## 1. OBJECTIVE

As a publicly-traded company, Grab Holdings Limited (the 'Company' or 'we'), directors, officers and employees of the Company, its subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities, and others who may have access to information regarding the Company are subject to securities laws relating to the treatment of undisclosed material information that prohibit trading in the  Company's  securities  while  in  possession  of  material  non-public  information  about  the  Company.  These  laws  also prohibit trading in the securities of other public companies to the extent that you come into possession of material non-public information of those companies.

The guidelines set out in this Trading Policy (the 'Policy') have been developed to protect the Company and those to whom this  Policy  applies  by  preventing  improper  trading,  and  the  appearance  of  improper  trading,  in  the  Company's  securities. These guidelines are in addition to, and do not replace, securities laws in the United States and other applicable jurisdictions governing the trading of the Company's securities.

It is essential that all persons to whom this Policy applies are aware of the laws relating to insider trading. It is your personal responsibility  to  ensure  that  when  you  propose  to  trade  in  the  Company's  securities  or  the  securities  of  other  public companies with which we do business, that you comply with this Policy and all applicable insider trading laws. If you are ever  unsure  of  whether  or  not  you  are  permitted  to  trade  in  the  Company's  securities  or  the  securities  of  another  public company, contact the Legal Department at \_\_\_\_\_\_ before you act.

## 2. SCOPE

This Policy applies to all directors, officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities and to consultants and contractors of the Company and its subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities, wherever located.

You should be particularly sensitive to ensuring that your spouse, partner or other family members who live with you do not, intentionally or unintentionally, gain access to undisclosed material information about the Company. The trading restrictions in this

Policy and under securities laws, as well as the potential consequences for violation, will apply to your spouse, partner or other family members if they gain access to undisclosed material information.

This  Policy  applies  to  all  trading  in  any  securities  of  the  Company,  including  any  of  the  Company's  shares,  securities convertible or exchangeable into shares or other securities of the Company, debt instruments, puts, calls, options and any other rights or obligations to purchase or sell securities of the Company. It also applies to derivative securities relating to the Company's securities, whether or not issued by the Company. 'Trading' for the purposes of this Policy includes purchases, sales and gifts, unless otherwise stated.

It is important to understand that this Policy applies to all securities that you beneficially own and/or over which you have direct or indirect control or direction, which includes securities owned by other persons (including family members, trusts or corporations) where you direct or influence their investment decisions.

## 3. DEFINITIONS

'Material  information'  means  any  fact  or  change  (or  a  decision  by  the  Board  of  Directors  or  senior  management  to implement a change) in  the  business,  operations,  financial  situation  or  capital  of  the  Company  that  would  reasonably  be expected to have a significant effect on the market price or value of the Company's securities. Material information also includes  information  that  a  reasonable  investor  would  consider  to  be  important  in  reaching  an  investment  decision. Any information that could be expected to affect a company's stock price, whether positive or negative, or whether the change is large or small, may be considered material.

It is not possible to define all categories of information that is or may be considered material, as the ultimate determination of materiality by enforcement authorities will be based on an assessment of all of the facts and circumstances. Information that is material at one point in time may cease to be material at another point in time, and vice versa. While the following is not intended to  be  an  exhaustive  list  or  a  substitute  for  the  exercise  of  judgment  in  making  materiality  determinations,  some examples of information that could be considered to be material include:

- ● operating and financial results;
- ● financial projections;
- ● proposed  mergers,  acquisitions  or  joint  ventures  involving  the  Company  or  divestitures  of  significant  assets  or  a subsidiary or consolidated affiliated entity by the Company;
- ● changes in control or management;
- ● Board of Directors changes;
- ● changes in officers or other senior management of the Company;
- ● public or private sales of the Company's securities;
- ● proposed or pending material financings;
- ● events of default under financing or other agreements;
- ● material transactions involving directors, officers or principal shareholders of the Company;
- ● labor disputes or disputes with key customers;
- ● natural disasters or any other significant event related to environment, health and safety;
- ● changes in the Company's auditors, or a notification from its auditors that the Company may no longer rely on the auditors' audit report;
- ● pending or threatened litigation;
- ● internal investigations and compliance-related matters;
- ● material impairments, write-offs or restructurings;
- ● creation of a material direct or contingent financial obligation;
- ● impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems;
- ● material agreements not in the ordinary course of business (or termination thereof);
- ● significant risks or incidents relating to cybersecurity, data protection or privacy;
- ● decisions or recommendations regarding dividend payments or policies or other modifications to the rights of the Company's securityholders;
- ● changes in capital or corporate structure; and
- ● significant  matters  which  could  affect  the  market  for  Company  securities,  such  as  a  forthcoming  research recommendation by a major brokerage firm or the intention by any party to buy or sell a large amount of Company securities.

'Undisclosed  material  information'  means  material  information  that  has  not  yet  been  generally  disclosed  to  the  public. Material information about the Company should be considered non-public or undisclosed unless there is a certainty that it is publicly  available.  As  a  general  rule,  material  information  is  only  considered  'generally  disclosed'  once  it  has  been accurately published and widely disseminated, making it generally available to investors, and sufficient time has elapsed in order for investors to react to the information. The circulation of rumors, even if accurate and reported in the media, does not constitute effective public dissemination. Given the requirement that sufficient time has elapsed for investors to react to the information, even after public disclosure of material information about the Company, you must wait one (1) full trading day before you can treat the information as public, unless otherwise advised by the Legal Department that the sufficient time period is longer or shorter in light of prevailing circumstances. The term 'trading day' means a day on which the stock exchange(s) on which the Company's securities are traded (currently Nasdaq) are open for trading.

## 4. GUIDELINES

## 4.1    Insider trading and tipping restrictions

Insider  trading  and  tipping  prohibitions  are  designed  to  ensure  that  anyone  who  has  access  to  undisclosed  material information does not trade or assist others in trading to the disadvantage of investors generally.

## (a) Persons in a 'special relationship' with the Company

You may come into possession of material information about the Company or other companies in the normal course of your work (such as news about financial results prior to public disclosure, material corporate transactions, significant management changes, etc.). Under applicable United States securities laws, directors, officers, employees, contractors and consultants of the Company, among others, are considered to be in a 'special relationship' with the Company and, as a result, are caught by the  prohibitions  against  insider  trading  and  tipping  described  below.  The  concept  of  a  special  relationship  with  a  public company is defined very broadly and extends to any person or company who falls within one of the categories summarized in Appendix A. Importantly, it also captures a potentially infinite chain of persons who receive undisclosed material information about the Company.

## (b) No trading on undisclosed material information

It is illegal and strictly prohibited by this Policy to directly or indirectly engage in any transaction involving a purchase or sale of the Company's securities, or otherwise engage in any transactions (including gifting), directly or indirectly, in any of the Company's securities, at any time when you have knowledge of undisclosed material information. To do so would be 'insider trading'.

You  may,  from  time  to  time,  have  to  forego  a  proposed  transaction  in  the  Company's  securities  even  if  you  planned  to complete the transaction before learning of the undisclosed material information. Questions about whether information is material, whether material information is now public or has been 'generally disclosed', or has ceased to be material, should be directed to the Legal Department of the Company.

Transactions that may be necessary or justifiable for independent reasons (such as the need to raise money to settle a tax payment  or  for  an  emergency  expenditure)  are  not  exempted  from  these  restrictions  or  the  restrictions  on  tipping.  The securities laws do not recognize mitigating circumstances and, in any event, even the appearance of an improper transaction must be avoided to preserve the Company's reputation for adhering to the highest standards of conduct.

## (c) No 'tipping' or 'recommending'

It is also illegal and strictly prohibited by this Policy to disclose, other than in the necessary course of business, undisclosed material information relating to the Company to any other person (such as, but not limited to, family members, neighbors, friends,  acquaintances,  investment  professionals,  financial  planners,  family  companies  or  family  trusts),  or  to  make recommendations or encourage the purchase, sale or gifting of the Company's securities on the basis of material non-public information. To do so would be 'tipping'.

The question of whether a particular disclosure is being made in the 'necessary course of business' is a mixed question of law and fact that must be determined on a case-by-case basis. While communications between employees, officers and board members, legal counsel, auditors and other professional advisors is generally acceptable, disclosure to analysts, institutional investors,  other  market  professionals  and  members  of  the  press  and  other  media  is  a  form  of  'tipping'  and  will  not  be considered  to  be  in  the  necessary  course  of  business.  Questions  about  whether  certain  proposed  disclosure  is  in  the 'necessary course of business' should be directed to the Legal Department of the Company.

## 4.2    Restrictions on short selling and other speculative trading

Those to whom this Policy applies must refrain from active or speculative trading involving the Company's securities based on  short-term  fluctuations  in  the  price  of  the  Company's  securities  or  other  market  conditions.  This  includes,  but  is  not limited to, short sales, trading in puts, calls or options or similar rights or obligations to buy or sell the Company's securities or derivative securities relating to the Company's securities, and the purchase of the Company's securities with the intention of quickly reselling them. You may, of course, exercise stock options granted to you by the Company and, subject to the restrictions discussed in this Policy, sell shares acquired through the exercise of those options.

A put is an option to sell a security at a specific price before a set date, and a call is an option or right to buy a security at a specific price before a set date. Generally, put options are purchased when a person believes the value of a security will fall, and call options are purchased when a person believes the value of a security will rise. A transaction in options is, in effect, a bet on the short-term movement of the Company's securities, and therefore creates the appearance of trading on the basis of material non-public information. Transactions in options may also focus your attention on short-term performance at the expense of the Company's long-term objectives. Accordingly, you may not engage in a put, call or other derivative security transaction relating to the Company's securities on an exchange or in any other organized market without prior approval from the Legal Department.

## 4.3    Hedging transactions

Those  to  whom  this  Policy  applies  are  also  prohibited  from  purchasing  financial  instruments  (such  as  prepaid  variable forward contracts, equity swaps or collars) designed to hedge or offset a decrease in the market value of the Company's securities.

Certain  forms  of  hedging  or  monetization  transactions,  including  zero-cost  collars,  equity  swaps,  exchange  funds  and forward sale contracts, allow a stockholder to lock in much of the value of his or her stock holdings, often in exchange for all or part of the potential for upside appreciation in the stock. These transactions allow the stockholder to continue to own the covered securities, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. Because participating in these transactions may cause you to no longer have the same objectives as the Company's other stockholders, you may not engage in such transactions without prior approval from the Legal Department.

## 4.4    Margin accounts and pledges

Securities held in margin accounts for collateral as a margined loan may be sold by the broker without the customer's consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged (or hypothecated) as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. A margin sale or foreclosure sale that occurs at a time when the pledgor is aware of material non-public information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in the Company's securities would fall under the restrictions in this Policy on trading during such times. Therefore, no person to whom the Policy is applicable may hold the  Company's  securities  in  a  margin  account  or  pledge  the  Company's  securities  as  collateral  for  a  loan  without  prior approval from the Legal Department.

## 4.5    Trading blackouts

The Company has established certain periods ('Blackout Periods') during which all directors, officers and employees of the Company shall refrain from conducting any transactions in the Company's securities.

Unless otherwise advised by the Legal Department, a Blackout Period will begin 15 days prior to the end of a fiscal quarter and will end one (1) full trading day after the public release of the Company's financial results for such fiscal quarter or yearend, as the case may be.

From time to time the Legal Department, in consultation with other departments within the Company, may impose special Blackout Periods, during which you and other affected persons  will  be  prohibited  from  engaging  in  transactions  in  the  Company's  securities.  In  the  event  of  a  special  Blackout Period,  the  General  Counsel  will  notify  you  and  other  affected  persons,  who  will  be  prohibited  from  engaging  in  any transaction involving the Company's securities until further written notice. The imposition of a special Blackout Period is itself confidential information, and the fact that it has been imposed may not be disclosed to others.

The Legal Department may shorten, suspend, terminate or extend any Blackout Period at such time and for such duration as deemed appropriate  given  the  relevant  circumstances. Any  persons  affected  by  such  a  modification  will  be  appropriately notified.

Even  in  the  absence  of  a  Blackout  Period,  any  person  possessing  undisclosed  material  information  about  the  Company should not engage in any transactions in its securities until  such  information  has  been  disclosed  publicly  for  one  (1)  full trading day.

## 4.6    Certain exceptions

Stock Option Exercises: This Policy does not apply to the exercise of any employee stock options, whereby you pay out-ofpocket to exercise and hold the stock, or to the 'net exercise' of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to have the Company withhold shares subject to an option to satisfy tax-withholding requirements. This Policy does apply, however, to any sale of shares as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an option or any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan: This Policy does not apply to purchases of Company stock resulting from your periodic contribution  of  money  to  any  employee  stock  purchase  plan  adopted  by  the  Company  from  time  to  time  pursuant  to  the election made by you at the time of enrollment. This Policy does apply, however, to (1) an election to participate in the plan for  any  enrollment  period,  (2)  sales  of  Company  stock  purchased  pursuant  to  the  plan  and  (3)  an  election  to  increase  or decrease the amount of automatic periodic contributions by payroll deduction to the plan.

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards: This Policy does not apply to the vesting and settlement of restricted stock  and  restricted  stock  units,  or  the  withholding  or  sale  of  stock  back  to  the  Company  to  satisfy  tax  withholding obligations upon the vesting of any restricted stock or restricted stock units. The Policy does apply, however, to any market sale of stock after vesting.

Class B Insider Transfers: To the extent such transfers are otherwise permissible, this Policy does not apply to transfers of Class B Ordinary Shares (as defined in the Company's Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the 'Articles'))  exclusively  among  Key  Executives  (as  defined  the Articles).  In  addition,  this  Policy  does  not  apply  to  other transfers of Class B Ordinary Shares exclusively among Key Executives and/or Permitted Entities (as defined in the Articles) or Permitted Transferees (as defined in the Articles); provided that prior to such transfer any Key

Executive whose Permitted Entities or Permitted Transferees are involved in such transfer has certified to the Company that such Permitted Entity or Permitted Transferee has access to all information available to such Key Executive at the time of decision-making with respect to such transfer; provided further that any such transfer occurring other than during a Blackout Period or absent such certification shall otherwise be subject to the terms of this Policy.

## 4.7    Retention of Incentive Securities on Company's platform

To enhance the Company's ability to enforce this insider trading policy, directors, officers and employees of the Company, subsidiaries  and  consolidated  affiliated  entities  must  keep  the  Company's  securities  acquired  under  the  Company's  share incentive plans (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any equity stock purchase plan) (the 'Incentive Securities') in the Company's equity management platform unless otherwise agreed by the Legal Department. However, directors and Section 16 Officers (as defined in Appendix B hereto) may transfer their Incentive Securities to their personal brokerage accounts for limited purposes, such as to establish a '10b5-1 trading plan', subject to prior approval by the Legal Department. In addition, Incentive  Securities  may  be  transferred  outside  of  the  Company's  equity  management  platform  upon  termination  of employment and/or services with the Company, provided that (i) directors and Section 16 Officers may not do so until three (3) months after their termination of employment and/or services with the Company unless otherwise agreed by the Legal Department; and (ii) the Legal Department may postpone the dates of such transfers made by those to whom this Policy applies in order to promote compliance with applicable insider trading laws.

## 4.8    Pre-clearance of trades by directors and Section 16 Officers

Before trading the Company's securities, directors and Section 16 Officers of the Company must obtain written pre-clearance from the Chairman of the Board of Directors (whereas for any trading by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the preclearance  shall  be  obtained  from  the  General  Counsel).  Each  proposed  trade  will  be  evaluated  to  determine  if  it  raises potential insider trading or other concerns under securities laws. Notwithstanding receipt of pre-clearance, (i) if the director or  Section  16  Officer  proposing  to  trade  the  Company's  securities  becomes  aware  of  material  nonpublic  information  or becomes subject to a Blackout Period before the trade is effected, they shall not proceed with the trade; and (ii) it remains the responsibility  of  such  director  or  Section  16  Officer  to  make  an  independent  determination  as  to  whether  they  possess material  nonpublic  information  when  the  trade  is  made  and  that  the  trade  is  not  in  violation  of  insider  trading  and  other applicable laws.

## 4.9    10b5-1 trading plans

Those to whom this Policy applies must follow the guidelines set forth in Appendix B hereto if they wish to adopt a 10b5-1 trading plan for the Company's securities.

## 4.10    Trading in securities of other companies

This Policy is not restricted to information affecting the Company's securities. You may obtain material information about other companies in the course of your work for the Company. As such, this Policy and the guidelines set out herein also apply to undisclosed material information about other companies or entities with which we do business, including but not limited to joint venture partners or service providers, customers, partners, vendors and suppliers of the Company, as well as potential take-over bid, merger or acquisition candidates (collectively, 'business counterparties'), when that information is obtained in the course of employment with or providing services to or on behalf of the Company.

Criminal and civil penalties, and termination of your relationship with the Company may result from trading in the securities of, or tipping or recommending trades in relation to, any business counterparty when in possession of undisclosed material information about that business counterparty. Undisclosed material information about the Company's business counterparties should be treated in the same way and with the same care as information related directly to the Company.

## 4.11    Confidentiality

You must maintain the confidentiality of the Company's non-public information. In the event you receive any inquiry or request for information (particularly financial results and/or projections, and including any inquiry or request to affirm or deny information about the Company), from any person or entity outside the Company, such as a stock analyst, and it is not part  of  your  regular  corporate  duties  to  respond  to  such  inquiry  or  request,  the  inquiry  should  be  referred  to  Investor Relations, which will determine whether such inquiry should also be forwarded to the Legal Department.

## 4.12    Policy awareness and consequences for violation

Copies of this Policy will be made available to directors, officers, employees, consultants and contractors, either directly or by posting the Policy on the Company's website, and such individuals will be informed whenever significant changes are made.

Insider trading and tipping are serious offences and the consequences can be severe. Company directors, officers, employees, contractors or consultants who violate this Policy will be subject to disciplinary action by the Company, including possible termination  of  their  relationship  with  the  Company.  This  is  in  addition  to  facing  significant  fines  and  penalties  and/or imprisonment. You should carefully consider how your trading activities may be construed by enforcement authorities who have the benefit of hindsight. Remedies available to the United States government or private plaintiffs under the securities laws in the United States include:

- ● administrative sanctions;
- ● civil injunctions;
- ● damage awards to private plaintiffs;
- ● disgorgement of all profits;
- ● civil fines for the violator of up to three times the amount of profit gained or loss avoided;
- ● civil fines for the employer or other controlling person of a violator (i.e., where the violator is an employee or other controlled person) of up to the greater of US$1,000,000 or three times the amount of profit gained or loss avoided by the violator;
- ● criminal fines for individual violators of up to US$5,000,000 (US$25,000,000 for an entity); and
- ● prison sentences of up to 20 years.

Insiders may also be liable for improper transactions by any person (commonly referred to as a 'tippee') to whom they have disclosed  undisclosed  material  information  regarding  the  Company  or  to  whom  they  have  made  recommendations  or expressed opinions on the basis of such information. Large penalties have been imposed even when the disclosing person did not profit from the trading.

Further,  any  such  activities  (or  even  an  accusation  of  securities  law  violations)  may  not  only  result  in  significant consequences for you, but could also be very damaging to the Company's reputation and its relationships with its business counterparties, and may expose it to liability.

The  Legal  Department  may,  from  time  to  time,  permit  departures  from  this  Policy  and  no  provision  contained  herein  is intended to give rise to civil liability to securityholders of the Company or other liability whatsoever.

## 4.13    Post-Termination Transactions

The restrictions set out in this Policy continue to apply even after termination of employment or service with the Company. If you are in possession of material non-public information when your employment or service terminates, you may not trade in the Company's securities (or another company's securities, as described in this Policy) until such information has become public  for  one  (1)  full  trading  day  or  is  no  longer  material.  If  your  employment  or  service  terminates  during  a  quarterly Blackout Period or a special Blackout Period, you will continue to be subject to the Blackout Period until its end date, unless otherwise determined by the Legal Department.

## 4.14    Review of the Policy

This Policy will be reviewed periodically by the Company in order to ensure that it continues to comply with applicable laws and good corporate governance practices.

This Policy may be amended at any time at the discretion of the Company's Legal Department.

## 4.15    Questions

If you have questions about general insider trading matters, any part of this Policy or your responsibilities under this Policy, please contact the Legal Department of the Company.

## 4.16    Acknowledgment

You must confirm your understanding of, and intent to comply with, this Policy by completing, executing and returning to the Legal Department of the Company the form provided in Appendix C hereto.

This includes a 'tippee' who is tipped by a previous 'tippee'.

## APPENDIX B

## RULE 10B5-1 TRADING PLAN GUIDELINES

Set forth below are guidelines for any Rule 10b5-1 trading plan covering the Company's securities proposed to be adopted by persons to whom the Company's Insider Trading Policy (the 'Policy') applies. In addition to the Policy and these guidelines, all 10b5-1 trading plans, as well as amendments, modifications or terminations of those plans, must comply with Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act'). For the purposes of these guidelines, 'Section 16 Officers' refers to personnel that would be deemed to be an 'officer' in accordance with Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

- (1) Participants. The Company's directors and Section 16 Officers are encouraged to adopt a 10b5-1 trading plan to govern all trades they make involving the Company's securities. Other employees are not expected to set up 10b5-1 trading plans but if they wish to do so they should arrange with their own brokers, and seek prior written approval from the Legal Department.
- (2) Plan Adoption and Approval . The 10b5-1 trading plan must be in writing and signed by the person establishing the plan. The Company will keep a copy of each 10b5-1 trading plan. The Legal Department must pre-approve, in writing, each 10b5-1 trading plan, including any amendment, modification or termination. Participants must enter into a plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act or Rules 10b-5 or 10b5-1 thereunder.
- (3) Representations .  Each 10b5-1 trading plan, including any Material Modification (as defined below) of a 10b5-1 trading plan, must include a representation by the participant certifying that he or she (A) at the time of adoption, (i) is not aware of any material non-public information about the Company or its securities; and (ii) is adopting the 10b5-1 trading plan or Material Modification of such plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act or Rules 10b-5 or 10b5-1 thereunder; and (B) will at all times act in good faith with respect to the 10b5-1 trading plan, including any amendments, modifications or terminations thereof.
- (4) Timing and Term of a Plan . A participant can only set up a 10b5-1 trading plan when the participant does not possess material non-public information about the Company. In addition, participants may only adopt a trading plan during an open trading window (as prescribed under the Policy) and at a time when the participant is not otherwise subject to any trading restrictions imposed by the Company. At the time of adoption, each 10b5-1 trading plan must have an expected term of at least  12  months  but  no  longer  than  24  months,  unless  otherwise  approved  by  the  General  Counsel  or  an  individual designated by the General Counsel. That said, 10b5-1 trading plans may provide for early termination at any time after 90 days following the day on which the participant is

no longer a director, officer or employee of the Company, provided that the participant no longer possesses any material non-public information about the Company.

- (5) Timing of a Plan Amendment or Modification . All amendments or modifications of a 10b5-1 trading plan must be preapproved by the General Counsel or an individual designated by the General Counsel. Each 10b5-1 trading plan may be amended or modified by a participant to change the amount, price or timing of the purchase, sale or gifting of the securities underlying the 10b5-1 trading plan, including to amend or change a written formula or algorithm, or computer program that affects the amount, price, or timing of the purchase, sale or gifting of such securities (a 'Material Modification'), only when the  participant  does  not  possess  material  non-public  information  about  the  Company.  In  addition,  participants  may  only enter into a Material Modification during an open trading window (as prescribed under the Policy) and at a time when the participant is not otherwise subject to any trading restrictions imposed by the Company. All Material Modifications will be considered a termination of the original plan and an adoption of a new 10b5-1 plan, triggering a new Cooling-Off Period, as described below in Section 7 under 'Delayed Effectiveness of First Trade'. A 10b5-1 Plan may not be amended or modified more than once in any 12-month period. Administrative changes to a 10b5-1 plan that do not affect the price, number or timing of a purchase, sale or gifting (or any written formula or algorithm, or computer program that affects the amount, price, or timing of a purchase, sale or gifting), such as adjustments for a stock split, will not be deemed a termination that triggers a new cooling-off period.
- (6) Termination .  Each  10b5-1  trading  plan  may  be  terminated  prior  to  expiration  in  accordance  with  its  terms  at  any  time, provided that such termination must be pre-approved by the General Counsel or an individual designated by the General Counsel. Participants are discouraged from terminating a 10b5-1 trading plan while in possession of material non-public information.  In  addition,  participants  are  discouraged  from  terminating  a  10b5-1  trading  plan  during  a  trading  blackout period (as prescribed under the Policy) or when such participants are subject to other trading restrictions imposed by the Company. If a participant terminates his or her 10b5-1 trading plan early after obtaining such approval, he or she may not trade in the Company's securities until 30 days after the date of termination or, if the day immediately following this 30-day period falls during a blackout period, after the end of that blackout period. This 30-day restriction does not apply to 10b5-1 trading plans that expire by their own terms (e.g., pursuant to the expiration date or where all shares included in the plan have been sold).
- (7) Delayed Effectiveness of First Trade . The first trade under a 10b5-1 trading plan cannot occur until the expiration of the applicable waiting period (the 'Cooling-Off Period') as follows: (i) if the participant is a director or Section 16 Officer of the Company, the later of (A) 90 days following the adoption of the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or (B) two business days following the disclosure of the Company's financial results in a Form 6-K or Form 20-F covering the fiscal quarter in which the plan was

adopted (subject to a maximum of 120 days after adoption of the plan), and (ii) for all other participants, at least 30 days. Following a Material Modification of a 10b5-1 trading plan, trades under the plan must not take place until the expiration of the applicable Cooling-Off Period measured from the date of the Material Modification.

- (8) Relationships  with  Plan  Broker;  No  Subsequent  Influence . If  the  10b5-1  trading  plan  allows  a  broker  discretion regarding the details of trading (e.g., timing, share amounts), the participant cannot communicate any material non-public information  about  the  Company  to  the  broker,  or  attempt  to  influence  how,  when  and  whether  the  broker  exercises  its discretion.
- (9) Plan Specifications; Single-Trade Plans . The 10b5-1 trading plan must specify the amount of stock to be purchased, sold or gifted, or specify or set an objective formula for determining the amount of stock to be traded. Transaction types such as market, limit and VWAP orders are allowed. Each 10b5-1 trading plan should specify the timing of trading or allow for the broker  to  exercise  its  discretion  regarding  the  timing  of  trading.  Other  than  10b5-1  trading  plans  providing  for nondiscretionary sell-to-cover transactions to satisfy tax withholding obligations arising exclusively from the vesting of a compensatory award, such as restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards ('Eligible Sell-to-Cover Plans'), 10b5-1 trading plans that are designed to effect the open-market purchase or sale or gifting of Company securities as a single trade may only be entered into once every 12-month period.
- (10) Other Trades . Except as may be pre-approved by the General Counsel or an individual designated by the General Counsel, no participant entering into a 10b5-1 trading plan may make open-market purchases or sales or gifting of the Company's securities  while  a  10b5-1  trading  plan  is  in  effect  other  than  in  connection  with  sell-to-cover  transactions  to  satisfy  tax withholding obligations arising exclusively from the vesting of a compensatory award, such as restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards, which shall be sold in compliance with applicable U.S. securities laws.
- (11) Only One Plan in Effect at Any Time . A participant may have only one 10b5-1 trading plan in effect at any time. A series of separate contracts with different broker-dealers to execute trades pursuant to a single 10b5-1 trading plan will be treated as a single plan. However, a participant may adopt an additional 10b5-1 trading plan if trading under the later-commencing plan  is  not  authorized  to  begin  until  after  all  trades  under  the  earlier-commencing  plan  are  completed  or  expire  without execution.  However,  if  the  first  plan  is  terminated  early,  the  first  trade  under  the  later-commencing  plan  must  not  be scheduled to occur until expiration of the applicable Cooling-Off Period measured from the date of termination of the first plan. This restriction on overlapping plans does not apply to Eligible Sell-to-Cover Plans, provided that the participant is not permitted to exercise control over the timing of the sales under such plans.
- (12) No Hedging . Participants subject to the Policy are prohibited from engaging in any hedging or similar transactions designed to decrease the risks associated with holding the Company's securities. Likewise, before adopting a 10b5-1 trading plan, the participant must not have entered into a transaction or position that has yet to settle with respect to the securities subject to the 10b5-1 trading plan. The participant must also agree not to enter into any such transaction while the 10b5-1 trading plan is in effect.
- (13) Mandatory Suspension or Termination . Each 10b5-1 trading plan must suspend trades or terminate if legal, regulatory or contractual restrictions are imposed on the participant, or other events occur that would prohibit trades under such a plan. For example, trading would need to be suspended or the plan terminated if these guidelines were amended to preclude the particular sort of trade contemplated by the plan.
- (14) Compliance with Rule 144 . Each 10b5-1 trading plan must provide for specific procedures to comply with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, including the filing of Forms 144, when and if applicable, including the disclosure of the adoption date of a Rule 10b5-1 plan that is applicable to the planned sale reported on the Form 144. If you need additional information on Rule 144 and Form 144, please contact the Legal Department.
- (15) Company Not Party to the Plan . The 10b5-1 trading plan must not have the Company as party to the plan.
- (16) Exceptions; Waivers . Any exception to or waiver of these guidelines must be pre-approved by the General Counsel or an individual  designated  by  the  General  Counsel,  or  in  the  event  that  the  General  Counsel  is  seeking  such  exception  to  or waiver of these guidelines, such request must be pre-approved by the Company's Chief Financial Officer.
