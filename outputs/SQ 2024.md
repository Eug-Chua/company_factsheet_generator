## CHAIRMAN'S LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

In a year marked by rising geopolitical tensions, supply chain constraints, cost inflation, and an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic landscape due to global tariff wars, the Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group successfully delivered another impressive performance in FY2024/25.

<!-- image -->

Revenues reached a new record as SIA and Scoot carried 39.4 million passengers, their highest ever, while the net profit of $2.8 billion included a one-off non-cash accounting gain of $1.1 billion from the completion of the Air India-Vistara merger in November 2024.

While operating profits fell 37% due to yield declines in a highly competitive landscape, both operating profits and passenger yields remain above pre-Covid levels. The performance also demonstrated our effective cost management through digital and staff productivity initiatives at a time of rising expenditure.

## LEVERAGING STRONG FOUNDATIONS

The SIA Group is well-positioned in this uncertain operating landscape thanks to our strong foundations - a robust balance sheet, industry-leading digital capabilities, and a committed workforce. These enable us to stay ahead in the airline industry by being agile, acting decisively when necessary, innovating continuously, and remaining clear-eyed about our strategic objectives during this time.

Our financial strength gives us a distinct advantage, enabling us to navigate uncertainties from a position of strength and seize new opportunities. Long-standing investments in digital capabilities provide a competitive edge. Since August 2022, SIA and Scoot have identified more than 300 Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) use cases, and implemented about 80, to enhance revenue generation, customer experience, and employee productivity.

I am, of course, extremely proud of our people, who are our greatest asset. Time and again, especially during uncertain times, they have pulled together to deliver the world-class travel experience for which SIA and Scoot are renowned for. We continue to invest in their development, particularly in areas such as digital skills, to ensure they stay future-ready in this rapidly evolving environment.

## STRATEGIC GROWTH AND MARKET POSITION

Investment continues in the three pillars of our brand promise - network connectivity, product leadership, and service excellence - to enhance the end-to-end customer experience.

Singapore's location as a hub in South East Asia gives us a strategic advantage as the regions around us continue their economic rise. The Group's well-diversified network also reduces dependency on any single region, while enabling us to respond swiftly to emerging opportunities.

Over the last year, SIA launched services to Brussels, London Gatwick, and Beijing Daxing. Scoot expanded its footprint with eight new destinations, seven in South East Asia and one in China, with six of those enabled by the introduction of its 112-seater Embraer E190-E2 aircraft.

Beyond organic growth, win-win airline partnerships such as those with All Nippon Airways and Garuda Indonesia have given us deeper access to key markets. By working more closely with our partners, we can offer more travel options and benefits to customers.

Our portfolio strategy, with two industry leaders in Singapore Airlines in the full-service premium segment and Scoot in the low-cost segment, allows us to serve a broader spectrum of markets and customers. We continue to strengthen synergies between both airlines, optimising fleet and network planning, enhancing cost efficiency, and delivering greater customer value.

With the completion of the Air India-Vistara merger, the SIA Group has a 25.1% stake in the enlarged Air India Group making us the only non-Indian airline with direct participation in one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets. Together with our partner Tata Sons, we are supporting Air India's ongoing transformation.

## ELEVATING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

We are reimagining SIA's long-haul travel experience and preparing to launch all-new long-haul cabin products, along with several new customer-facing initiatives, in the first half of 2026. We have also committed $1.1 billion to an Airbus A350 retrofit programme, ensuring almost all our long-haul aircraft fleet will feature these next-generation cabin products.

On the ground, we will transform the SilverKris and KrisFlyer Gold lounges at Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 2 over the next two years, investing $45 million to elevate the on-ground customer experience at our main hub. Beyond Singapore, we have upgraded our lounges at London Heathrow and Sydney, with other overseas facilities to follow.

True to Singapore Airlines, we continue to offer the personalised touches that make a huge difference to our highly discerning customers. That is why we introduced the Cristal 2015 champagne in our Suites and First Class cabins in 2024, further delighting our premium customers.

Our world-class cabin crew won Skytrax's World's Best Cabin Crew award for the fourth time in 2024. This reflects the spirit of service excellence that is embedded in our culture and is central to the Singapore Airlines brand promise.

## FOCUS ON SUSTAINABILITY GOALS

We advanced our sustainability goals through deeper collaboration with partners including industry stakeholders, governments, and fuel producers.

For example, we secured 1,000 tonnes of neat Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from Neste and signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Aether Fuels to support their efforts to develop potential new feedstocks. These partnerships accelerate our progress towards replacing 5% of our total fuel needs with SAF by 2030 and achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

We remain firmly committed to supporting the communities we serve. We launched the Singapore Airlines Foundation in June 2024 with a $30 million endowment, focusing on programmes that uplift vulnerable youth and cultivate Singapore's next generation of aviation professionals.

Our annual SIA Cares initiative showcases the Group's strong global volunteer culture. In August 2024, over 350 employees organised the SIA Cares Open House at the SIA Training Centre for more than 500 beneficiaries from 24 social service agencies. Another 930 staff across our global network supported 52 organisations, distributing essential food items and preparing meals for families in need.

## LOOKING AHEAD

While aviation landscape is rapidly evolving, the SIA Group is in a strong position to not only withstand these changes but to shape them. The continued focus on our customers and operational efficiency will enable us to extend our leadership position, and deliver greater value to all stakeholders.

On behalf of my fellow directors, I extend my sincere appreciation to our customers, shareholders, partners, government agencies, fellow Singaporeans, and especially our dedicated staff for their unwavering support.

## OUR STRATEGY FOR THE FUTURE

The Singapore Airlines Group remains committed to maintaining its position as a leading airline in the industry. By leveraging its strong foundations, the Airline is well positioned to seize growth opportunities and navigate challenges in an agile and flexible manner.

<!-- image -->

## 1.  Delivering on Our Brand Pillars

SIA continues to strengthen its industry-leading position through the three pillars of its brand promise: Service Excellence, Product Leadership, and Network Connectivity. These pillars continue to guide SIA's efforts to deliver world-class experiences, reinforcing its reputation as the airline of choice for customers.

<!-- image -->

## SERVICE EXCELLENCE

## PRODUCT LEADERSHIP

## NETWORK CONNECTIVITY

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

SIA continues to raise the bar in delivering exceptional service throughout the end-to-end customer journey, from pre-flight to in-flight and post-flight. This commitment is supported by the Airline's focus on attracting and nurturing top talent, as well as continued investments in training and development, to uphold the high standards customers have come to expect from the Airline.

In FY2024/25, the SIA Group continued to expand its route network, adjusting capacity to meet evolving market demand while pursuing new growth opportunities. The Group increased flight frequencies to key markets including the Americas, China, Europe, and South East Asia.

It also reinstated services to cities such as Chengdu, Chongqing, Shenzhen, and Xiamen.

To better anticipate and respond to customer needs, SIA also deepened its use of artificial intelligence (AI). By leveraging AI tools to analyse customer data with greater speed and precision, the Airline is able to sharpen its ability to deliver more personalised, meaningful interactions across its touchpoints.

SIA continues to invest in innovative, high-quality products to maintain its position as a global leader in air travel.

In November 2024, the Airline announced plans to install its next-generation longhaul cabin products  across 41 Airbus A350-900 long-haul and ultra-longrange (ULR) aircraft. This $1.1 billion investment aims to elevate the premium travel experience for customers across its network.

Enhancements also extended to the ground experience. SIA re-opened its SilverKris lounges at London Heathrow and Sydney on 31 July 2024 and 24 August 2024, respectively. Both lounges were upgraded with expanded seating areas and a broader selection of food and beverage options, designed to offer greater comfort and convenience for travellers.

SIA also launched new non-stop services to Brussels in April 2024 and London Gatwick in June 2024, followed by daily flights  to  Beijing  Daxing  in  November 2024.

Meanwhile, Scoot launched services to eight new destinations during the financial year: Kertajati, Koh Samui, Malacca, Padang, Phu Quoc, Shantou, Sibu, and Subang. Scoot also expanded its network with new services to Iloilo City in April 2025, and launched its first service to Vienna in June 2025.

## 2.   A Portfolio Strategy Built for Flexibility and Growth

Through its diversified portfolio strategy, the SIA Group maintains a leading presence in both the full-service premium segment with Singapore Airlines, and the low-cost segment with Scoot.

This enables the Group to leverage synergies between the two airlines, allowing it to adapt nimbly to dynamic market demands, capture growth opportunities, and deploy aircraft to the right markets.

## 3.   Advancing a Multi-hub Growth Strategy

The Group's Vistara joint venture with Tata Sons in India has enabled it to pursue its multi-hub strategy by allowing it to establish a direct presence in growth markets outside Singapore.

In November 2024, SIA and Tata Sons celebrated the successful merger of Air India and Vistara, marking the start of a new era of their deep and longstanding partnership. This move strengthens SIA's foothold in India, one of the world's fastest growing economies, driven by a young population and rising income levels.

As the third-largest aviation market globally, India holds considerable potential for international air travel. The newly expanded Air India Group is well positioned to tap this opportunity, with a broad portfolio that spans full-service and low-cost carriers across both domestic and international segments.

SIA and Tata Sons are firmly committed to supporting Air India's transformation strategy, which aims to enhance its operational capabilities, service standards, and product offerings.

## 4.   Strengthening Strategic Partnerships

Developing and maintaining win-win partnerships remains a key part of the SIA Group's strategy to expand its network reach and enhance value for customers.

In June 2024, SIA signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a new partnership with upcoming airline Riyadh Air.

The following month, SIA received regulatory approval to embark on a commercial joint venture with Garuda Indonesia. Over the course of FY2024/25, both airlines strengthened their partnership by offering reciprocal frequent flyer benefits and expanding codeshare arrangements.

Meanwhile, SIA and Air India significantly expanded their codeshare agreement in October 2024 for the first time in more than 10 years, adding 11 Indian cities and 40 international destinations to their network.

SIA also launched a commercial joint venture with All Nippon Airways in April 2025, following approval from the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore. This partnership allows the two airlines to more effectively coordinate flight schedules between Singapore and Japan, introduce more competitive fare options, and provide a smoother travel experience for customers.

## 5.   Enhancing Digital Capabilities

The SIA Group continues to embrace digital transformation as a key strategic enabler across its operations. Since August 2022, SIA and Scoot have identified over 300 use cases for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), with around 80 already implemented to support revenue generation, enhance customer experience, improve operational efficiency, and boost employee productivity.

One such tool is JARVIS, a GenAI-powered intelligent assistant that enables employees, regardless of technical background, to leverage AI to create content and optimise workflows.

The Group also invested in building new in-house capabilities, while ensuring secure and responsible use of AI in the workplace. This enables sustainable scalability and application of AI across the organisation.

In March 2025, SIA announced a collaboration with Salesforce to deploy AI-driven applications that deliver more personalised and consistent customer service. The Airline also partnered with OpenAI in April 2025 to enhance existing tools to bolster customer experience and operational efficiencies.

Innovation is also driven through KrisLab, SIA's digital innovation lab, which collaborates with startups, SMEs, and research institutions to explore emerging technologies and foster open innovation. Since its inception in 2019, KrisLab has co-developed more than 70 proof-of-concepts, with over 25 digital solutions successfully implemented across the Group.

## THE YEAR IN REVIEW

The Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group reported record revenues for FY2024/25, bolstered by resilient demand for passenger travel and air cargo throughout the year.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

## BALANCE SHEET POSITION

Revenue climbed $527 million (+2.8%) from the previous year to $19,540 million, with SIA and Scoot carrying a record 39.4 million passengers, up 8.1% year-on-year. Group passenger load factor (PLF) fell 1.4 percentage points to 86.6%, with SIA and Scoot achieving PLFs of 86.1% and 88.4%, respectively. This decline occurred as the 6.4% growth in passenger traffic lagged the 8.2% increase in capacity.

Passenger yields dipped 5.5% to 10.3 cents per revenue passenger-kilometre amid intensified competition due to industry-wide capacity increases. For the year, passenger flown revenue reached $15,849 million (+1.0%).

Cargo flown revenue improved by $94 million (+4.4%) to $2,213 million, buoyed by strong demand for e-commerce and perishables, as well as spillover demand from disruptions to sea freight. While the cargo load factor (CLF) rose 1.6 percentage points to 56.1%, yields decreased 7.8% due to increased competition.

Group expenditure rose $1,546 million (+9.5%) to $17,831 million in FY2024/25. Non-fuel expenditure increased by $1,236 million (+11.0%), driven by an 8.9% growth in overall capacity and ongoing cost pressures. This was partially offset by the Group's cost management measures, including digitalisation and productivity improvement initiatives. Net fuel cost increased by $309 million (+6.1%), as higher uplift volume (+$508 million) and smaller fuel hedging gains (+$336 million) were partially offset by an 8.5% reduction in fuel prices (-$510 million) and favourable exchange rate movements (-$25 million).

As a result, the Group recorded an operating profit of $1,709 million for FY2024/25, down $1,019 million (-37.3%) from the prior year.

The Group's net profit was up 3.9% at a record $2,778 million, boosted by the one-off non-cash accounting gain of $1,098 million following the completion of the Air India-Vistara merger in November 2024.

Following the SIA Group's excellent performance, the Board of Directors has recommended a final dividend of 30 cents per share for FY2024/25. Including the interim dividend of 10 cents per share paid on 11 December 2024, the total dividend for FY2024/25 will be 40 cents per share, representing a total dividend distribution of $1.2 billion for the year. Subject to shareholders' approval at the Annual General Meeting on 25 July 2025, the final dividend (tax exempt, one-tier) will be paid on 27 August 2025 for shareholders as of 11 August 2025.

The Group's shareholder equity stood at $15.7 billion as of 31 March 2025, $0.7 billion lower than 31 March 2024, largely due to the redemption of the remaining Mandatory Convertible Bonds (MCBs) in June 2024, along with the payments of the FY2023/24 final dividend and FY2024/25 interim dividend. Total debt balances fell $0.5 billion to $12.9 billion, with the debt-equity ratio remaining flat at 0.82.

Cash and bank balances declined by $3.0 billion to $8.3 billion, mainly due to capital expenditure disbursements ($1.8 billion), MCB redemption ($1.7 billion), dividend payments ($1.4 billion), and the investment in Air India ($1.0 billion). This was partially offset by $4.7 billion in net cash generated by operations. The Group also held $1.8 billion in fixed deposits with tenors exceeding 12 months, which are classified under other assets.

Beyond holding one of the strongest balance sheets in the airline industry, the Group maintains access to additional liquidity of $3.3 billion through committed lines of credit that are currently undrawn.

## STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND OUTLOOK

The global airline industry continues to operate in a challenging environment amid shifting tariff policies, heightened trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainties, and continued supply chain disruptions. While these headwinds affect the entire industry, the SIA Group  remains vigilant, closely monitors developments, and is ready to respond swiftly to market conditions as needed.

The Group will leverage its strong foundations - a robust balance sheet, a talented and dedicated workforce, as well as industry-leading digital capabilities - to navigate these challenges. SIA will also continue to invest in its brand pillars, airline portfolio, commercial partnerships, and hubs in both Singapore and India.

At the same time, shifting global passenger and trade flows present new avenues for growth. With a well-diversified passenger and cargo network, the Group is well positioned to capture demand. Singapore's role as a key hub at the heart of fast-growing markets in South East Asia, South Asia, and the wider Asia-Pacific further enhances the Group's competitive advantage.

The Group's portfolio strategy, anchored by its two industryleading carriers in SIA and Scoot, provides it with the flexibility to offer customers a wide range of options while responding nimbly to changing market dynamics.

Group passenger load factor (PLF) remains buoyant at

## 86.6%

SIA achieved a record PLF of

Scoot delivered a PLF of

## 88.4%

As of 31 March 2025, the Group's operating fleet comprised 205 aircraft with an average age of seven years and eight months. SIA operated 145 passenger aircraft 3  and seven freighters, while Scoot had 53 passenger aircraft 4 . The Group had 78 aircraft on order 5 as of 1 May 2025.

Fleet modernisation remains central to the Group's strategy. In FY2024/25, SIA and Scoot took delivery of 13 aircraft 6  from Airbus, Boeing, and Embraer. The addition of the 112-seater Embraer E190-E2s enabled Scoot to launch new routes to Kertajati, Koh Samui, Malacca, Phu Quoc, and Sibu, supporting the Group's strategy of expanding its regional network with these efficient aircraft.

SIA began services to three new destinations during the year -  non-stop services to Brussels in April 2024, London Gatwick in June 2024, as well as daily services to Beijing Daxing in November 2024.

As a result, the Group's passenger network 7  covered 128 destinations in 36 countries and territories as of 31 March 2025. SIA served 79 destinations while Scoot operated to 71 destinations. The cargo network comprised 132 destinations in 37 countries and territories.

The Group continued to invest in its product offerings to strengthen its competitive edge, delivering greater value and a more seamless travel experience for customers.

In November 2024, SIA announced a $1.1 billion multi-year investment to install its all-new long-haul cabin products across 41 Airbus A350-900 long-haul and ultra-long-range (ULR) aircraft. These products will also be featured on the upcoming Boeing 777-9 fleet, setting a new standard in premium travel across the Airline's network.

Details of the full suite of redesigned cabin products for First Class, Business Class, Premium Economy Class, and Economy Class, along with the latest KrisWorld in-flight entertainment system, and enhanced long-haul travel experience, will be unveiled in the first half of 2026.

Strategic partnerships with like-minded carriers continue to unlock growth opportunities for the Group, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. During the financial year, SIA entered into commercial joint venture agreements with Garuda Indonesia and All Nippon Airways, strengthening opportunities for collaboration that benefit customers. SIA also established a new partnership with the upcoming Riyadh Air, while also significantly expanding codeshare arrangements with Air India.

On 12 November 2024, SIA and Tata Sons (Tata) successfully completed the Air India-Vistara merger, reinforcing the Group's multi-hub strategy. SIA now holds a 25.1% stake in the enlarged Air India, enabling its continued direct participation in the fast-expanding Indian aviation market. SIA and Tata are firmly committed to supporting the growth of Air India, which has a strong presence across all key segments of the Indian market.

The Group continued to accelerate its digital transformation, with a strong focus on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) solutions to drive revenue, improve customer service, enhance operational efficiency, and boost workforce productivity.

SIA also invested in building new in-house capabilities, while ensuring the secure and responsible use of GenAI in the workplace. This approach enables SIA to scale up its use of GenAI across the organisation as required.

To support this transformation, the Group has equipped employees with the necessary resources and training to incorporate GenAI tools into their everyday work processes. SIA has also partnered with leading technology firms, Salesforce and OpenAI, to co-develop innovative GenAI tools.

SIA's upgraded London Heathrow and Sydney SilverKris lounges re-opened on 31 July 2024 and 24 August 2024, respectively. Both lounges now feature expanded seating and enhanced food and beverage options, elevating the customer experience. Over the next two years, SIA will also upgrade its SilverKris and KrisFlyer Gold lounges at Changi Airport Terminal 2, further enhancing the experience at its main hub.

Despite ongoing global uncertainties, the Group remains well positioned to maintain profitability, capture new growth opportunities, and create long-term value for its shareholders.

The SIA Group extends its deepest gratitude to all customers, partners, staff, and stakeholders for their steadfast support.

## NETWORK

The demand for air travel remained healthy in FY2024/25, supported by the continued growth of key markets.

To capture this momentum, SIA increased flight frequencies and boosted passenger capacity across its network to support the higher demand for air travel to several popular destinations in Australia, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, and New Zealand.

In Europe, SIA expanded its footprint with the addition of non-stop services to Brussels in April 2024 and London Gatwick in June 2024. SIA also increased the frequency of its non-stop services to Milan and Rome to four-times weekly, strengthening connectivity to Southern Europe. To adjust capacity in response to shifting demand, SIA suspended flights to Houston via Manchester in April 2025, replacing it with a direct service between Singapore to Manchester.

Closer to Singapore, SIA increased its services to Jakarta to eight daily flights, while Scoot continued to expand its network in South East Asia by launching new routes to Kertajati, Koh Samui, Malacca, Phu Quoc, Sibu, and Subang during the financial year. All routes, except for Subang, are operated with the new Embraer E190-E2 aircraft, which supports the Group's strategy of expanding its reach to thinner regional routes more efficiently through these 112-seater jets.

SIA stepped up its frequencies of direct flights to key South East Asian cities in May 2025, with Jakarta serving nine daily flights, up from eight, and Manila five daily flights, up from four. Scoot also expanded its network in the Philippines with the launch of new services to Iloilo City in April 2025.

SIA and Scoot strengthened their presence in mainland China by reinstating services to key Chinese cities such as Chengdu, Chongqing, Shenzhen, and Xiamen. SIA introduced new daily services to Beijing Daxing in November 2024, while Scoot restructured its services to the Chinese market in response to shifting demand, suspending flights to Jinan, Nanchang, and Ningbo, while launching new services to Shantou. As at 31 March 2025, the SIA Group served 24 points in the country, with SIA serving nine destinations and Scoot serving 17 destinations.

Beyond Asia, SIA increased its direct services to Seattle to five daily flights  in May 2025 in response to heightened demand, while Scoot debuted its first service to Vienna in June 2025.

As a result of these changes, the SIA Group's passenger network stood at 128 destinations as at 31 March 2025. SIA operated 1,184 weekly services to 79 destinations by the end of FY2024/25, including Singapore. Meanwhile, Scoot operated 591 weekly frequencies to 71 destinations, including Singapore.

## FLEET

The Singapore Airlines Group continues to invest in a modern, fuel-efficient fleet to support its fleet renewal strategy and growth plans, while enhancing operational efficiency and contributing to its efforts to reduce carbon emissions. In FY2024/25, SIA expanded its fleet with the addition of two Airbus A350-900s and four Boeing 787-10s, while Scoot took delivery of one Airbus A320neo, one Boeing 787-8 8 , and five Embraer E190-E2s.

As of 31 March 2025, the Group had 205 passenger and freighter aircraft in its operating fleet, with a combined average age of seven years and eight months. This is one of the youngest fleets in the airline industry, where the global average is more than 15 years 9 .

SIA's passenger aircraft fleet comprised 145 aircraft with an average age of seven years and three months. This included 65 Airbus A350-900s, 12 Airbus A380-800s, 16 Boeing 7378s, four Boeing 737-800 NGs, 22 Boeing 777-300ERs, and 26 Boeing 787-10s.

SIA also operates five Boeing 777-200F freighters with a joint DHL-SIA livery under a Crew and Maintenance agreement with DHL Express, which was signed in March 2022.

SIA's aircraft order book includes 56 passenger aircraft on firm order, comprising 13 Boeing 737-8s, 31 Boeing 7779s, and five Boeing 787-10s, as well as seven Airbus A350F freighters on firm order.

Scoot's operating fleet of 53 aircraft comprised 11 Airbus A320ceos, seven Airbus A320neos, nine Airbus A321neos, 11 Boeing 787-8s, 10 Boeing 787-9s, and five Embraer E190-E2s.

Scoot is the first airline in Singapore to operate the Embraer E190-E2, complementing its larger Airbus A320 and Boeing 787 aircraft. The E190-E2, which joined Scoot's fleet in April 2024, enhances its ability to serve thinner routes to nonmetro destinations,.

On the cargo front, SIA's freighter aircraft fleet comprised seven Boeing 747-400F freighters with an average age of 21 years and four months.

In addition to four Embraer E190-E2s, Scoot has another 11 Airbus A320neos, six A321neos, one Boeing 787-8, and one Boeing 787-9 on firm order, bringing its order book to 23 aircraft.

CARGO

## Singapore Airlines' cargo segment recorded a 1.6% year-on-year increase in cargo loads, generating $2,213 million in revenue for FY2024/25.

The strong momentum in the first half of the year was driven by robust demand for e-commerce goods and higher traffic due to sea freight disruptions and port congestion. This performance was sustained in the second half by continued strength in e-commerce flows, a rise in freighter charter activity, and healthy demand for the transport of perishables.

## EXPANDING REACH IN HIGH-VALUE CARGO SEGMENTS

SIA continued to strengthen its leadership in key cargo verticals, particularly in pharmaceutical, perishables, and event logistics; sectors that demand precision, consistency, and high service standards.

The Airline's THRUCOOL pharmaceutical logistics programme expanded its quality corridor network to 23 destinations worldwide as of 31 March 2025. THRUCOOL is designed to manage temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical cargo, ensuring optimal conditions throughout the transport process. As THRUCOOL approaches its third anniversary, the ongoing re-validation of its stations helps ensure that the programme continues to meet the evolving needs of the pharmaceutical industry, and reinforces SIA's commitment to excellence in this critical segment.

Meanwhile, the THRUFRESH network for perishable cargo has grown to serve 17 destinations. Designed to uphold the integrity of the cold chain, THRUFRESH provides customers with trusted, high-performance logistics for time- and temperature-sensitive goods, ensuring produce and perishables arrive fresh and in peak condition.

SIA also continued to showcase its logistics capabilities by operating charters for concert tours and motorsports events such as Formula One. These highlight the Airline's ability to support high-profile events with specialised logistics services, ensuring the safe and timely transport of essential equipment and materials for the global sports and entertainment industry.

## ACCELERATING E-COMMERCE GROWTH

Parxl, SIA's cross-border e-commerce logistics platform, continued to scale its global footprint in FY2024/25 to better serve the growing needs of online merchants. Designed to support seamless international delivery, Parxl expanded its active delivery network to more than 30 destinations worldwide.

To drive further growth and enhance its offerings, Parxl introduced new technologies, including GenAI, to strengthen business development capabilities. It also deepened its integration with major e-commerce platforms, enabling faster onboarding and improved service delivery for merchants.

With a focus on agility and personalisation, Parxl is committed to providing tailored logistics solutions and a competitive, user-friendly platform, ensuring it stays ahead in the dynamic and fast-paced e-commerce space.

## STRENGTHENING KEY CAPABILITIES

SIA's cargo segment continued to strengthen its digital capabilities and operational resilience through strategic partnerships, innovation, and workforce initiatives.

## Expanding Digital Marketing Presence

Building on its partnership with air freight distribution platform cargo.one, SIA's Cargo Division expanded its digital marketing presence by integrating with two additional platforms: WebCargo in June 2024 and CargoAi in September 2024. Freight forwarders in more than 20 markets can now conveniently book cargo space across the SIA Group's network.  Plans are underway to expand coverage to more stations and introduce new service offerings on these platforms in FY2025/26.

## Enhancing Efficiency with Cargo Digital Checklist

The Cargo Digital Checklist (CDC), initially deployed in Singapore under the SIA-DHL Express partnership, has now been implemented across all destinations in the SIA-DHL freighter network. The CDC automates routine cargo checks and provides real-time alerts for anomalies, enabling prompt action and enhancing operational safety. This digital tool has delivered efficiency gains equivalent to approximately 1,200 man-hours saved per year.

## Leveraging GenAI to Boost Productivity

SIA has adopted GenAI to unlock new efficiencies. With the introduction of JARVIS, SIA's intelligent chatbot assistant, staff can now quickly retrieve operational guidelines, cargo sales procedures, and IT system information, reducing reliance on manual document searches and peer support.

## Fostering Collaboration

To further embed innovation and collaboration within the organisation, the Cargo Division launched a pilot run of the Cargo Strategy and Innovation Programme. The initiative empowers cross-functional workgroups to co-develop ideas that support workforce needs and build business resilience. In FY2024/25, eight initiatives were identified and developed, delivering benefits for both the business and employees.

## DEEPENING PARTNERSHIPS

SIA's Cargo Division expanded its partnerships with IBS Software and Cargo Community Network (CCN) on the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) ONE Record data-sharing standard. ONE Record is an end-to-end digital logistics and transport supply chain, where data is transparently and securely exchanged among air cargo stakeholders.

Collaborating closely with IBS, CCN, and IATA, SIA championed this global initiative through a series of presentations at key industry events in Singapore, Bangkok, Geneva, and Hong Kong SAR. These outreach efforts helped build momentum for a more connected and standardised global air cargo ecosystem.

Together with SATS Ltd, CCN, and IBS, SIA also implemented two advanced freight status update initiatives, namely Freight into Warehouse and Freight out of Warehouse, under the ONE Record platform. These initiatives significantly enhance shipment tracking visibility, particularly for time and temperature-sensitive cargo during operations.

## CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

In FY2024/25, SIA enhanced its use of data analytics and artificial intelligence to better understand and respond to customers' evolving needs, improving the overall travel experience.

## DELIVERING DELIGHTFUL EXPERIENCES WITH DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS &amp; DESIGN

<!-- image -->

## HARNESSING AI TO UNLOCK CUSTOMER INSIGHTS

SIA leverages AI to analyse data from customer feedback, social media interactions, and Voice of Customer (VoC) survey responses. By integrating this information with operational data and customer profiles, the Airline is able to create a more holistic view of the end-to-end customer journey, enabling more precise identification of customer concerns.

In FY2024/25, SIA reviewed processes for customer assistance by analysing customer interactions with the SIA contact centres. This review identified opportunities to enhance service delivery through automation. Automating previously manual processes now drives efficient solution development, streamlining customer processes, reducing transaction time, and enhancing service delivery.

SIA also leveraged AI tools to analyse feedback related to its customers' baggage journey, efficiently identifying frequent sources of concern. This approach allowed for timely escalation to the relevant teams to follow up on customers' baggage concerns. The refined baggage handling process improved SIA's Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores in this area.

## ENABLING PERSONALISED EXPERIENCES

SIA taps on two key digital platforms - the Customer Insights Portal (CIP) and the Customer Experience Management (CEM) system - to enable its staff to deliver a more personalised customer experience.

The CIP consolidates customer feedback and offers a comprehensive view of customer sentiment across all touchpoints in the travel journey. Recently enhanced with GenAI capabilities, the portal

now provides near real-time insights to SIA staff worldwide, enabling more efficient analysis of customer feedback. A recent upgrade to the post-flight VoC survey introduced individual meal ratings, providing SIA's In-flight Food and Beverage team with valuable feedback and data to evaluate and refine specific in-flight dishes.

Meanwhile, the CEM system enables personalisation at scale. SIA introduced a service recommender tool that alerts frontline staff on opportunities to deliver services that are better tailored to enhance the customer experience. This includes recommendations to recognise and delight first-time flyers travelling in First Class, and proactive measures to prevent recurrence of negative experiences.

<!-- image -->

## DESIGNING JOURNEYS TO DELIGHT CUSTOMERS

SIA adopts a data-driven approach to design customer journeys, ensuring its product and service offerings remain relevant to its diverse and evolving customer base.

In November 2024, the Singapore Airlines Foundation's inaugural Youth Outreach Programme invited 45 junior college students to explore the complexities of designing customer offerings and understand young travellers' travel habits and preferences. Recognising that brand loyalties often form early in life, SIA is using these insights to refine offerings for the next generation of customers. Internally, SIA organised staff workshops to examine how personal milestones influence travel experiences across life stages and to generate ideas for enhancing festive experiences for customers.

These collaborative sessions with young travellers of the future and staff have not only contributed to service enhancements, but also fostered stronger customer and staff engagement, with participants being co-designers in elevating the SIA customer journey.

## CHAMPIONING A CUSTOMER-CENTRIC CULTURE

'Customer Focus' is a core value at SIA that drives the Group's commitment to delivering exceptional experiences. In FY2024/25, the Airline intensified efforts to embed a customer-first mindset across the organisation, evolving from training and practice to actively recognising and celebrating customer experience excellence.

On 1 October 2024, SIA commemorated Customer Experience Day, celebrating employees who go above and beyond to design and deliver world-class customer experiences. To mark the occasion, an internal digital community was launched, spotlighting stories of customer experience champions and their impactful contributions. All staff were encouraged to join the platform, share their own memorable customer moments, and exchange best practices with their peers.

<!-- image -->

As part of this heightened focus on the customer, the inaugural SIA CEO Innovation Awards launched in March 2025 featured a Special Mention - Customer Experience category.  This award recognises individuals and teams who have made a tangible impact on the customer journey through innovative service ideas and delivery approaches.

SIA also organised webinars to nurture a shared understanding of customer experience across its global network. The Discover! Series of talks that features a range of internal and external thought leaders has seen growing interest, attracting over 400 employees seeking practical insights and real-world applications.

A highlight in May 2024 was a joint session with the National University of Singapore Institute of Systems Science (NUS-ISS), which explored the use of data-driven customer journey maps. The series also explored behavioural science, examining how subtle design choices can shape more meaningful and human connections with customers.

## AIRPORT OPERATIONS

In FY2024/25, Singapore Airlines continued its close collaboration with airport authorities and service partners across its network to ensure smooth operations, supporting a seamless travel experience for customers globally.

## FACILITATING SEAMLESS TRAVEL FOR CUSTOMERS

## MAINTAINING OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AT SINGAPORE CHANGI AIRPORT

SIA worked with local airport authorities to introduce self-service kiosks in Bengaluru, Manchester, Nagoya, Phuket, Seoul, and Shanghai in FY2024/25.

During the financial year, the Airline also rolled out self-service bag drop facilities in Darwin, Bengaluru, Frankfurt, Fukuoka, Manchester, Nagoya, Osaka, Phuket, Shanghai, and Tokyo (Narita), to offer greater convenience and flexibility for its customers. These initiatives further streamlined the customer journey and enhanced their travel experience.

In FY2024/25, Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 2's capacity decreased due to the closure of several gates for the ongoing Terminal 5 infrastructure works, which is expected to continue for several years. To minimise the disruption to customers, the SIA Airport Operations team collaborated with the Changi Airport Group to optimise the usage of the remaining gates and expand operations at Terminal 1's flexible gate facilities. These proactive measures have been instrumental in maintaining a smooth travel experience for SIA's customers despite the ongoing construction works.

## ENHANCING SIA'S SILVERKRIS LOUNGES IN LONDON AND SYDNEY

In FY2024/25, SIA continued to enhance its customer experience with refreshed SilverKris lounges in London and Sydney.

The London Heathrow SilverKris Lounge re-opened in July 2024 after an extensive six-month-long refurbishment. The space now accommodates up to 242 customers, a 16% increase in seating. The upgrade also brought in a wider range of food and beverage offerings, expanded seating options that include long table seats and private pods, and created a more luxurious environment.

Over at Sydney, the SilverKris Lounge at Terminal 1 reopened in August 2024 following a two-week refresh. Updates included new furniture in the First Class and Business Class sections, such as the signature batik motif wingback chairs, as well as redesigned productivity pods for greater privacy. A new barista bar was also introduced in the Business Class section, offering freshly brewed beverages throughout the day. The space was further enhanced with updated carpeting and lighting for a more inviting ambience.

In April 2025, SIA announced that it will be transforming its SilverKris and KrisFlyer Gold lounges at Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 2 over the next two years, investing $45 million to elevate the on-ground customer experience at its main hub.

Renovations are progressing in phases, with completion expected around mid-2027. The revamped lounges will boast 50% more space and seating capacity, and feature upgraded facilities, signature elements from SIA's flagship lounges at Changi Airport Terminal 3, and an enhanced variety of food and beverage options.

These enhancements and investments reflect SIA's ongoing commitment to delivering a premium ground experience that matches the excellence of its in-flight service.

## ELEVATING THE PREMIUM TRAVEL EXPERIENCE WITH A350 CABIN UPGRADES

In  November 2024, SIA unveiled plans to roll out its next-generation long-haul cabin products across 41 Airbus A350-900 long-haul and ultra-long-range (ULR) aircraft, a $1.1 billion investment to elevate the premium travel experience across its network.

The first retrofitted A350-900 long-haul aircraft is expected to enter service in the second quarter of 2026, while the first retrofitted A350-900ULR variant will follow in the first quarter of 2027. The entire programme is targeted for completion by the end of 2030.

For seven of SIA's A350-900 ULR aircraft, the Airline will introduce an all-new First Class cabin, designed to offer a truly luxurious experience on the world's longest routes. Business Class customers can look forward to a refined travel experience with SIA's upcoming Business Class seats, featuring innovative designs that will offer even greater levels of privacy, comfort, and convenience.

KrisFlyer also deepened its partnership with Singapore's yuu Rewards Club during the financial year. In July 2024, KrisFlyer introduced the option to convert yuu Points to KrisFlyer miles. This was followed in March 2025 by the ability to convert KrisFlyer miles to yuu Points, offering members greater flexibility in managing their rewards across both programmes.

In November 2024, KrisFlyer introduced KrisFlyer Cruise, providing members with a new avenue to earn miles for cruise fares booked from over 40 top cruise lines. This addition further diversified the programme's offerings and expanded earning opportunities for its members.

KrisFlyer also expanded its regional partnerships in FY2024/25. In India, the new KrisFlyer-SBI credit card was launched in October 2024, offering members more ways to earn miles on everyday spend, and providing an accelerated route to attain an elite status.

Meanwhile, in Vietnam, SIA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with loyalty ecosystem LynkiD in December 2024, paving the way for a new points-to-miles conversion programme, and the potential for a future two-way partnership.

Kris+, SIA's lifestyle rewards app, continued to expand its footprint in Singapore and Australia.

As of 31 March 2025, Kris+ featured 480 partners with over 1,600 outlets in Singapore, offering privileges in dining, retail, travel and transportation. In Australia, the network expanded to include more than 175 partners with over 225 outlets in Melbourne and Sydney.  The platform welcomed new merchants including Bengawan Solo, City Chain, Seoul Garden Buffet, and Swarovski, further enhancing the variety of merchants available to members. This enabled SIA to continue offering Kris+ members a wide variety of options with more than 1,200 partners, and over 4,400 outlets globally.

## ENGAGING AND THANKING KRISFLYER MEMBERS

Throughout the year, KrisFlyer rolled out a variety of initiatives to reward and connect with members, offering more ways to earn and redeem miles across the SIA Group's ecosystem.

Building on the foundational GenAI 101 e-learning programme, SIA introduced GenAI 201 workshops to equip managers with the knowledge and tools to prioritise GenAI use cases. The GenAI 202 workshop also helped to develop technical capabilities for Scrum Masters and Developers to build GenAI applications.

SIA also launched Sustainability 101, an e-learning programme that outlines the organisation's key sustainability initiatives and commitments. The programme aims to raise awareness and encourage employee participation in advancing SIA's sustainability goals.

## Driving Commercial, Operational, and Service Excellence

In FY2024/25, nearly 2,000 frontline service leaders completed the Leading Service as One (LSAO) programme, equipping them with the mindset, skills, and tools for exceptional service delivery. SIA also refreshed the core service training modules to better meet evolving customer expectations.

SIA revised its Delay Handling and Announcement Training programme for Station Managers, focusing on effective management of flight disruptions and service recovery.

A key highlight was Fus3ion, SIA's flagship operational excellence programme, which brought leaders from various operational departments together to share perspectives and reaffirm their commitment to safety, security, and service excellence.

The SIA Group Family Road Run brought together nearly 1,500 employees and their families from across the Group on 26 October 2024. Held at Palawan Green, Sentosa, the event featured competitive and leisure runs, as well as family-friendly activities such as carnival games and workshops.

<!-- image -->

## SUSTAINABILITY

## In FY2024/25, the Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group reaffirmed its commitment to sustainability by continuing to embed environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles across its operations.

A core part of this strategy is the Group's ambition to achieve net zero carbon emissions from its operations by 2050. To reach this goal, SIA has embarked on several decarbonisation pathways, aligned with the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) Four-pillar Strategy.

## INVESTMENTS IN NEW-GENERATION AIRCRAFT

These efforts include investing in new-generation aircraft, enhancing operational efficiencies, adopting low-carbon technologies such as sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), and supporting global market-based measures as a harmonised approach to reduce emissions from international aviation.

Operating a younger, more fuel-efficient fleet is central to the SIA Group's long-term carbon emissions reduction strategy. New-generation aircraft are expected to make up 90% of the Group's fleet by 2030. This includes existing aircraft like the Airbus A320neos, A321neos, A350s, Boeing 787s, and the Embraer E190-E2s. The upcoming Airbus A350F freighters and Boeing 777-9s will also contribute to the modernisation of the fleet.

The average age of the Group's operating fleet is seven years and eight months as of 31 March 2025, just over half the industry average 10 . More than 70% 11  of the Group's operating fleet comprised new-generation aircraft.

<!-- image -->

- 10 As of 31 March 2025, the global fleet age as reported by Centre for Aviation (CAPA) was 15 years.
- 11 As of 31 March 2025, the SIA Group's operating fleet size was 205 aircraft, where 149 aircraft were new-generation aircraft types (Airbus A320neos, A321neos, A350s, Boeing 737-8s, 787s, and Embraer E190-E2s).

<!-- image -->

## ADOPTING SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUELS

## INCREASING OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES

The adoption of SAF is key to the SIA Group's long-term plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

In May 2024, SIA signed an agreement with Neste to purchase 1,000 tonnes of neat SAF, which marked the first time locally produced SAF was directly supplied for use on flights departing from Singapore Changi Airport.

In February 2025, the Group signed a Memorandum of Understanding to potentially source neat SAF from climate technology firm Aether Fuels. During the first quarter of 2025, the SIA Group also signed an agreement with Neste to acquire 1,000 tonnes of Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)-certified SAF, supporting its decarbonisation journey while gaining valuable insights into the pathways, standards, and certification systems in the renewable fuel landscape.

The SIA Group enhances operational efficiencies across its engineering, flight, and ground operations by using digital insights, advanced technologies, and strategic partnerships. This includes leveraging analytics to optimise aircraft performance, such as aerodynamic configurations and weight, to improve fuel efficiency without compromising flight safety or performance.

SIA also charts more fuel-efficient flight paths by factoring in weather patterns, air traffic, and airspace restrictions. From August 2024 to April 2025, SIA participated in a user-preferred routing (UPR) trial implemented by the Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) in Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Singapore. This trial allowed pilots to operate more direct and fuel-efficient routes 12 .

## CARBON OFFSETTING AND CORSIA PARTICIPATION

Recognising the need to align global SAF supply with demand, the SIA Group will continue to collaborate with governments and industry partners to further deploy and commercialise sustainable fuel in the aviation industry.

While prioritising efforts to cut emissions at source, the SIA Group recognises that carbon offsetting serves as a valuable complement to address residual emissions that cannot yet be eliminated through new technology, more efficient operations, or the use of SAF.

- 12 Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), 'Singapore, Australia, Indonesia and New Zealand Launch User-Preferred Routing Trials for 38 Flight Routes'.

<!-- image -->

## SUSTAINABILITY (Continued)

The SIA Group supports CORSIA, a global market-based initiative by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to offset residual carbon emissions. Since 2019, SIA has adhered to CORSIA's Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) requirements, acknowledging its role in helping the aviation industry achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

## Energy Conservation

## RESOURCE CONSERVATION INITIATIVES

## Waste Management

The SIA Group employs the 5R principle (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover, and Refuse) to minimise its environmental impact. Initiatives include reducing single-use plastics and adopting sustainable materials across its operations where feasible, and enhancing recycling efforts with suppliers and caterers.

In FY2024/25, SIA replaced half of the plastic used for Economy Class earphones packaging with kraft paper, while Scoot switched from pulp paper to recycled paper serviettes. SIA is also testing food waste recycling systems for unconsumed meals and paper meal boxes from inbound Singapore flights, potentially converting them into renewable energy sources and fish feed for aquaponic farms. Additionally, trials are underway to repurpose used polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles into bitumen, which can be used for road paving and repairs.

Since June 2023, all SIA-owned buildings in Singapore have been equipped with solar panels, generating an estimated 6,372 MWh of renewable energy annually. Of this amount, 5,458 MWh of clean energy was used to power SIA's buildings in FY2024/25, equivalent to offsetting 2,249 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO₂e), with the excess unconsumed energy sent to the grid.

SIA aims to reduce electricity consumption by 10% in its four buildings (Airline House, SIA Training Centre, TechSQ, and SIA Supplies Centre) by FY2029/30, compared to FY2019/20 levels. A chiller plant upgrade is in progress at Airline House, aimed at improving the system's efficiency by 30%, with completion targeted for the fourth quarter of 2026. Air-handling units (AHUs) across SIA's Airline House, TechSQ, and SIA Training Centre will also be progressively retrofitted with energy-efficient electrically commutated (EC) fans to reduce energy use.

In October 2024, SIA completed the replacement of fluorescent office lighting and sodium vapour streetlights with light-emitting diode (LED) fixtures at the SIA Supplies Centre, making the site fully LED-equipped. In addition, SIA plans to install on-demand LED streetlights with photocell sensors at the SIA T raining Centre. These enhancements to air-conditioning and lighting systems reduce energy use and emissions, while lowering the need for maintenance and minimising resource waste over time.

## CREATING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON SOCIETY

The SIA Group remains committed to making a positive impact on the communities it serves, both in Singapore and across its global network. In FY2024/25, the Group supported a wide range of initiatives that uplift lives and strengthen community ties. These include providing aid to those in need, nurturing emerging sporting talent, championing the arts, and promoting environmental responsibility.

More details of the SIA Group's corporate social responsibility efforts can be found in the Society chapter in the SIA FY2024/25 Sustainability Report.

## SIA Cares Around the World

SIA Cares, the Airline's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme, reflects its ongoing commitment to give back to society and support the communities that it serves in Singapore and beyond. In FY2024/25, there was a 13.8% increase in staff volunteers that took part in monthly CSR activities.

On 31 August 2024, the SIA Cares Open House welcomed over 500 beneficiaries from 24 different social service agencies at the SIA T raining Centre. Participants toured the Group's training facilities, interacted with employees, and explored its latest innovations, a new feature at this year's event.

The event was a success thanks to the efforts of more than 350 employee volunteers from across the Group, many of whom contributed their personal time to support the event. SIA Cares Global CSR week was also held in tandem in August 2024, with over 900 SIA employees from over 50 cities worldwide coming together to support underprivileged and special needs communities. Focusing on food security and children's wellbeing, employees contributed over 5,000 volunteer hours through activities such as delivering care packages, preparing meals, and educating youth on food waste and sustainability.

## Combating Illegal Wildlife Trade

In March 2025, Scoot engaged the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES) to conduct an illegal wildlife trade awareness programme for 20 staff. This initiative included a tour of the ACRES Wildlife Rescue Centre and a talk conducted with TRAFFIC, a global wildlife trade monitoring network. This programme enhanced participants' understanding of illegal wildlife trade and equipped them with the skills to identify and report suspicious activities.

## THE SINGAPORE AIRLINES FOUNDATION

The Singapore Airlines Foundation was officially incorporated in June 2024, supported by a $30 million endowment contributed by SIA. The Foundation aims to create meaningful and lasting impact in the lives of individuals and communities in need in Singapore through collaborative efforts with key partners, including those from the aviation industry.

In its inaugural year, the Foundation launched two flagship initiatives: the Youth Uplift Programme and the Youth Outreach Programme. These annual programmes aim to benefit more than 100 youths each year.

## Youth Outreach Programme

## Youth Uplift Programme

In 2024, the programme selected 20 students from the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). Each student is eligible for a $3,000 study award per academic year. Beyond financial support, the programme offers traineeship placements across the SIA Group, mentorship opportunities, and access to skillsbased workshops covering topics such as communications and presentation.

## SCOOT

Scoot accelerated its growth in FY2024/25 by expanding its fleet and network, harnessing new technologies, and investing more deeply in its people and culture. These strategic moves enabled Scoot to seize new opportunities and navigate challenges, while maintaining operational efficiency.

## EXPANDING HORIZONS WITH A MODERN FLEET

Scoot also expanded its global reach through interline agreements with Air New Zealand and Bangkok Airways, and a codeshare partnership with Air Canada, during the year in review.

Scoot welcomed its first Embraer E190-E2 aircraft in April 2024, complementing its fleet of Airbus A320 Family and Boeing 787 aircraft. The 112-seater aircraft is an important addition to the SIA Group's operating fleet, unlocking significant growth potential in the Asia-Pacific region by enabling it to serve thinner routes to non-metro destinations.

Scoot's first E190-E2 aircraft operated its inaugural flights to Krabi and Hat Yai on 7 May 2024. Since then, Scoot has added four more E190-E2 aircraft to its fleet, with the remaining four scheduled to arrive by end-2025. Scoot continued to receive deliveries of Airbus A320s and Boeing 787s alongside the E2 jets.

## ENHANCING THE TRAVEL EXPERIENCE

Scoot continued to refresh its products and services to meet evolving customer expectations in FY2024/25. Responding to demand for greater flexibility and peace of mind when travelling, Scoot expanded Scootsurance to cover departures from Australia, and introduced a new Cancel Your Trip option alongside its existing Change Your Flight service. In March 2025, Scoot launched Upgrade2plus, offering eligible customers discounted upgrades to ScootPlus for a more comfortable journey.

The expansion of Scoot's fleet enabled the airline to launch services to eight new destinations in FY2024/25: Kertajati, Koh Samui, Malacca, Padang, Phu Quoc, Shantou, Sibu, and Subang. Scoot further expanded its network with services to Iloilo City on 14 April 2025, and Vienna on 3 June 2025. Scoot suspended services to Berlin, Jinan, Nanchang, and Ningbo, aligning capacity with demand.

With the addition of Iloilo City and Vienna, Scoot operates to 73 destinations across 18 countries and territories as of 3 June 2025.

Scoot also enhanced benefits for its growing KrisFlyer customer base, including exclusive Pelago travel and attraction discounts, with new offerings and user experience improvements in development.

To streamline the customer journey, Scoot progressively introduced self-service check-in kiosks at several airports, including Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur (KLIA2 and Subang), Melbourne, Tokyo (Narita), and Penang.

## INNOVATION IN ACTION

Scoot continued to integrate GenAI initiatives across its operations to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency. The airline upgraded its website and mobile app to improve the user experience and launched a GenAI-powered search function in October 2024 to enhance result relevance and efficiency.

Scoot also upgraded its customer service chatbot, MARVIE, with GenAI capabilities to handle more complex customer queries, such as the cost of additional check-in baggage. The enhanced chatbot also takes into consideration contextual cues, enabling it to respond to customer queries with greater empathy and personalisation. Real-time translation via GenAI also enables English-speaking agents to serve customers in multiple languages, improving efficiency and accessibility.

In May 2024, Scoot introduced the Scoot Agency Booking Portal to strengthen engagement with its online travel agents. The portal features tools such as a price estimator, which provides approximate fare estimates even at the initial stages of the booking process. In addition, the new portal enabled more seamless onboarding of new agents. These enhancements have resulted in the platform receiving positive feedback and high user satisfaction scores.

Scoot streamlined its crew operations with the launch of SKY in November 2024, an in-house mobile app that provides cabin crew with convenient access to schedules, tools, and resources. Crew members can download the app on their personal devices, enhancing crew productivity and convenience.

## PRIORITISING OUR PEOPLE

Scoot is committed to employee development and recognition. In January 2025, Scoot renewed its Singapore Collective Agreement, reinforcing a shared vision with the Scoot Staff Union (STSU) to make work purposeful and rewarding for its employees.

To ensure success in this fast-paced airline industry, Scoot emphasised continuous learning and upskilling. The annual Learnfest event featured 20 expert-led sessions on future-ready skills. Scoot's Academic Co-sponsorship Programme returned for a second year, covering 90% of tuition fees for selected employees who are pursuing further education.

Scoot also introduced an updated career model for all flight crew and launched LEAP, an accelerated development pathway for captains to support career mobility and future leadership readiness.

## SCOOT (Continued)

In March 2025, Scoot hosted its inaugural Employee Appreciation Week, culminating in a Long Service Awards night honouring over 80 staff for their contributions.

## RECOGNISED FOR EXCELLENCE

Scoot's continued excellence was widely recognised in FY2024/25 with a host of accolades. For the fourth year running, Scoot was named Best Long Haul Low-Cost Airline at the Skytrax World Airline Awards and Best Low-Cost Carrier at the TTG Travel Awards. It also received the Best Low-Cost Carrier (Asia Pacific) title at the T ravel Weekly Asia Readers' Choice Awards 2024. Scoot's commitment to sustainability also earned it the CAPA Asia Pacific Environmental Sustainability Award for 2024.

On the commercial front, Scoot received accolades for its digital campaigns, including Gold for Best Social Media Campaign at the Hashtag Asia Awards 2024, Gold for Marketing Innovation at the M360 Digital Nations Awards 2024, and Silver at the Effie Awards 2024 in the Business Turnaround category. Scoot's successful launch of the E190-E2 was also celebrated with the Event/Launch of the Year award at the PRCA APAC Awards 2025, highlighting its creativity and impact across the region.

## SIA ENGINEERING COMPANY

## BUSINESS UPDATES

## Bolstering Resilience and Investing in Growth

SIA Engineering Company (SIAEC) achieved steady growth in FY2024/25, buoyed by healthy demand for Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) services stemming from the continued recovery in global air travel.

In Singapore, SIAEC's Line Maintenance operations handled 8% more flights during the financial year, supported by healthy traffic at Changi Airport. By the fourth quarter, the number of flights handled was close to pre-Covid volumes and continued to rise. The SIAEC Group expanded its Line Maintenance network to 36 airports across nine countries, adding new stations in Indonesia and Japan. These international stations also recorded increased flight volumes.

Demand for Base Maintenance check  remained stable, although some aircraft required extended hangar time due to complex repair requirements. This resulted in longer average hangar occupancy periods in FY2024/25 compared to the previous year.

Meanwhile, SIAEC's engine and component shops processed higher volumes of repair and overhaul work. To meet growing demand, the company doubled its engine test capacity by streamlining rosters to enable extended shift hours, and plans to expand its engine test capabilities for the CFM LEAP-1B engine.

SIAEC has experienced limited direct impact from higher tariffs, though it recognises that indirect effects may emerge over time. The company is proactively implementing measures to manage these risks and is keeping a close watch on global trade developments, geopolitical shifts, and trends in air travel and aircraft usage.

Amidst the uncertainties in the operating environment, SIAEC will continue to strengthen its core business, while remaining open to new opportunities as conditions evolve.

To drive sustainable growth, SIAEC will continue to invest in three key areas: expanding its footprint across the AsiaPacific region, building additional capacity and capabilities for next-generation aircraft maintenance, and enhancing its core business to deliver greater value to airline customers.

## Growing Across Asia's Key Aviation Hubs

The Asia-Pacific region continues to drive global air travel, accounting for more than half of passenger traffic growth in 2024 . With this trend expected to continue in the years ahead, SIAEC is focusing its expansion efforts in this fastgrowing region.

The company's component services also benefitted from the uptick in flight activity, alongside an expanded range of MRO capabilities. At the end of FY2024/25, SIAEC was managing 187 aircraft from nine airlines under its Inventory Technical Management programme.

Over the past year, the company has strengthened its presence with new Line Maintenance stations in Indonesia and Japan. It also established TIA Engineering Services Company Limited to provide Line Maintenance services at Cambodia's upcoming Techo International Airport, which is expected to begin operations in September 2025.

<!-- image -->

## SIA ENGINEERING COMPANY (Continued)

SIAEC is also deepening its reach in India and China, two key markets for the region's aviation growth. During the financial year, Air India appointed SIAEC as its strategic partner to develop its base maintenance facility in Bengaluru, slated to open in 2026. In China, SIAEC signed a non-binding agreement with Xiamen Iport Group to explore investing in its subsidiary, Airport Aircraft Maintenance &amp; Engineering (Fujian), which provides line maintenance and ground handling services.

## Growing Capacity and Capabilities for New-generation Aircraft

As airlines modernise their fleets, SIAEC is expanding its regional capacity and technical capabilities to support newgeneration aircraft. This will position the company to meet the airlines' evolving needs and capture future growth in next-generation aircraft maintenance.

<!-- image -->

## KEY DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE YEAR INCLUDE:

## Base Maintenance Malaysia

One of two new hangars in Subang will open in the second half of 2025, adding cost-efficient capacity for base maintenance. The facility will support upcoming cabin retrofit work on SIA's A350 long-haul fleet and feature fully digital operations.

## Eaton Aero Services

Eaton Aero Services' new Shah Alam facility in Malaysia remains on track to open by second half of 2025, enabling the 49% SIAEC-owned joint venture to provide MRO services for Eaton-manufactured components.

## SIA Engineering (Philippines) Corporation (SIAEP)

In the Philippines, SIAEP became Asia-Pacific's first authorised service centre for Embraer's E-Jets E2 family of aircraft.

## Singapore Aero Engine Services (SAESL)

The 50% SIAEC-owned joint venture with Rolls-Royce began construction of a new Loyang facility in January 2025. Once completed, this state-of-the-art facility will increase SAESL's capacity for next-generation Rolls-Royce engines by 40% and become the world's largest maintenance site for these engines. SAESL is also expanding its Seletar site to support advanced repair technologies.

## Eagle Services Asia (ESA)

ESA, a 49% SIAEC-owned joint venture with Pratt &amp; Whitney, completed a major facility upgrade in February 2024, boosting Geared Turbofan overhaul capacity by two-thirds. The facility continues to scale up to meet rising demand.

## Cabin Maintenance and Retrofit

To support SIA's fleet growth and diversify its offerings to third-party customers, SIAEC expanded its cabin maintenance and retrofit capabilities for new aircraft types, including the Boeing 777X.

## STRENGTHENING SIAEC'S CORE OPERATIONS

Beyond expanding its regional presence, SIAEC is focused on strengthening its core business to boost efficiency, agility, and competitiveness, while upholding high standards of safety and quality.

A new company-wide Enterprise Operating System is being rolled out in phases to streamline MRO processes and improve productivity. This includes applying Lean principles to reduce waste and improve planning and operations.

Digital tools are also being adopted to support smarter decisionmaking. These include:

- · The in-house eLITE system which improves efficiency in Line Maintenance.
- · The eTask platform being implemented to better manage planning and work execution in Base Maintenance and Engine Services.
- · A new eSlot tool that leverages data to optimise hangar space planning.

SIAEC is also exploring the use of AI and robotics to support inspections and defect management. Meanwhile, staff are receiving training in Generative AI applications, which will help automate routine tasks and improve overall productivity.

## Recognised for Excellence

SIAEC's efforts in innovation, customer service, and talent development earned it several key awards in FY2024/25:

- · Its eLITE digital suite won the Digital - Aviation award at the Singapore Business Review Technology Excellence Awards 2024.
- · At the MRO Asia-Pacific Awards 2024, SIAEC was named Aftermarket Service Provider of the Year and received Marketing Campaign of the Year for its 1SIAEC branding efforts.
- · The company earned two Gold Standard awards at the Singapore HR Awards 2024 for excellence in Learning, Development, Coaching and Mentoring and Talent Management &amp; Acquisition.
- · It was also honoured with the SkillsFuture Work-Study Programme Employer Appreciation Award for supporting workforce training.
- · The Straits Times named SIAEC as one of Singapore's Best Employers 2025.

## Advancing Sustainability Goals

SIAEC is making steady progress towards its 2030 environmental targets under its decarbonisation framework. Recent initiatives include:

- · Solar energy: Installation of additional solar panels at its Philippine facility, and addition of panels to sheltered walkways and carparks in Singapore.
- · Green mobility: Following the introduction of electric tow tractors, SIAEC plans to replace its internal combustion vehicles with electric models.

As part of the final phase of adopting the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, SIAEC has completed a climate scenario analysis to better understand the financial risks of climate change. It has also expanded Scope 3 emissions reporting to cover more of its supply chain. These efforts support a smooth transition to the International Financial Reporting Standards Sustainability Disclosure Standards, and reflect SIAEC's commitment to transparency and responsible climate governance.

## In FY2024/25, SIA further strengthened its travel experience platform, Pelago, by launching a dedicated mobile application and deepening its integration within the SIA Group ecosystem.

As at 31 March 2025, Pelago offers more than 200,000 experiences, encompassing attractions, travel activities and tours, across over 150 countries. These can be booked via the Pelago app or website, or through the Kris+ app, providing customers with greater flexibility and convenience. SIA and Scoot customers, as well as KrisFlyer members, continue to enjoy exclusive deals on the platform, with the added benefit of earning and redeeming miles as part of their journey.

This alphanumeric code is provided to customers when they book a flight with SIA or Scoot.

During the year in review, Pelago completed its payment integration with Kris+, enabling customers to earn KrisPay miles on eligible purchases. This development, alongside the launch of the Pelago mobile app, contributed to stronger user engagement and platform growth.

Pelago extended its exclusive promotion on travel activities to include Scoot customers. As a result, both SIA and Scoot customers can now enjoy discounts on Pelago-booked travel activities by entering their unique flight booking reference code.

These developments reflect the SIA Group's commitment to delivering added value for its customers both in the air and on the ground.

## AIRBUS ASIA TRAINING CENTRE

## CELEBRATING A DECADE OF EXCELLENCE

Airbus Asia Training Centre (AATC), a joint venture between Singapore Airlines and Airbus, celebrated its 10 th  anniversary in 2024. AATC, the world's largest Airbus flight crew training facility, houses nine Full Flight Simulators: two Airbus A320s, one A330, one A380, four A350s, and one ATR 72-600.

To commemorate the milestone, AATC held a special event in November 2024 titled Celebrating a Decade of Excellence. The occasion brought together AATC staff, airline partners, and stakeholders to reflect on the centre's journey and reaffirm its commitment to high-quality training and innovation.

In FY2024/25, AATC welcomed four new airline customers: Air Niugini, Hong Kong Express, KM Malta Airlines, and Skytrans. The centre also expanded its training capabilities with the introduction of a new A330 Airbus Procedure Trainer (APT) Standard 3, which supports both New Engine Option (NEO) and Current Engine Option (CEO) aircraft variants. These developments reflect AATC's ongoing commitment to meet growing demand for pilot training with industryleading solutions.

## DRIVING SUSTAINABILITY ON THE GROUND

As part of its sustainability agenda, AATC installed 900 photovoltaic panels on its rooftop in October 2024. The solar panels are expected to generate more than 500 MWh of electricity annually that will meet around 18% of the facility's power needs. The centre has also teamed up with the SP Group to deploy the GET Control smart cooling system, which enhances thermal comfort while improving energy efficiency.

Smaller but meaningful initiatives are also making an impact. In June 2024, AATC rolled out the #BringYourOwnCup campaign to cut down on single-use cups. As part of this effort, new pilot trainees now receive a reusable tumbler in their welcome kit. Furthermore, the centre has begun replacing fluorescent lights with energy-efficient LED tubes, a move projected to cut Scope 2 emissions by 30 tonnes each year.

## INSPIRING FUTURE AVIATORS

AATC continued to champion diversity and education in aviation through its partnership with Women in Aviation International - Singapore Chapter (WAI-SG). The fourth edition of WAI-SG's Project Give Flight initiative welcomed young women from various backgrounds for an immersive experience that included simulator sessions and talks by over 30 volunteers from Airbus and AATC. The programme highlighted a wide range of aviation careers, as well as raised awareness of sustainability issues in the industry.

Following the success of Project Give Flight, AATC will adapt the programme into a broader outreach framework aimed at schools to bring aviation career opportunities closer to the next generation.

## GROUP PROFIT

The Group registered an operating profit of $1,709 million for the financial year, a decline of $1,019 million from the previous year due to weaker performance from the Group Airlines. Operating performance was weighed down by higher costs from capacity expansion and rate increases, and lower revenue growth amidst intensified competition.

Group revenue rose $527 million (+2.8%) year-on-year to a record $19,540 million, driven by resilient demand for air travel and cargo uplift.

Passenger flown revenue increased $164 million to $15,849 million on the back of a 6.4% growth in passenger traffic (measured in revenue-passenger kilometres), partially offset by a 5.5% decline in passenger yields. Group passenger load factor ('PLF') declined 1.4% points to 86.6%, as passenger capacity (measured in available seat-kilometres) rose 8.2%, higher than the traffic increase.

Cargo flown revenue improved by $94 million (+4.4%) to $2,212 million, buoyed by the strong demand for e-commerce and perishables as well as the spillover from disruptions to sea freight. While the cargo load factor ('CLF') rose 1.6% points to 56.1%, yields decreased 7.8% due to increased competition.

|                         | 2024/25 $ million   | 2023/24 $ million   |    |   %Change |
|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----|-----------|
| Passenger flown revenue | 15,848.5            | 15,684.7            | +  |       1   |
| Cargo flown revenue     | 2,212.2             | 2,118.6             | +  |       4.4 |
| Engineering services    | 521.6               | 449.1               | +  |      16.1 |

| Total revenue           | 19,539.8            | 19,012.7            | +  |       2.8 |

## GROUP PROFIT (Continued)

Group expenditure increased $1,546 million (+9.5%) year-on-year to $17,831 million.

Fuel cost after hedging rose $309 million (+6.1%) to $5,386 million, largely from higher fuel volume uplifted due to higher capacity deployed (+$508 million) and lower fuel hedging gains (+$336 million). These were partially offset by a decrease in average jet fuel prices (-$510 million) as well as a weaker US Dollar against the Singapore Dollar (-$25 million).

Non-fuel expenditure increased $1,237 million (+11.0%), mainly attributable to the expansion in operations and increase in rates.

The Group's net profit improved $103 million (+3.9%) to a record $2,778 million, due to a non-cash accounting gain following the completion of the Air India-Vistara merger during the year (+$1,098 million), mitigating the weaker operating performance (-$1,019 million).

## FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

## PERFORMANCE OF THE GROUP (Continued)

## FINANCIAL POSITION

Equity attributable to owners of the parent fell by $682 million (-4.2%) to $15,656 million as at 31 March 2025, largely due to the redemption of mandatory convertible bonds ('MCBs') (-$1,548 million), payment of dividends (-$1,429 million), reduction in fair values on hedges (-$295 million) primarily from  fuel hedges with a decrease in average forward fuel prices and maturity of contracts, as well as recognition of accreted interest on redemption of MCBs (-$197 million) during the year. These were partially offset by the net profit for the financial year (+$2,778 million).

## GROUP EQUITY HOLDERS' FUNDS, TOTAL ASSETS AND NET ASSET VALUE (NAV) PER SHARE

Total Group assets fell $1,178 million (-2.7%) to $43,087 million, mainly due to a decrease in cash and bank balances (-$2,999 million), derivative assets (-$736 million), right-of-use assets (-$284 million) and trade debtors (-$159 million). These were partially offset by an increase in associated companies (+$2,085 million) and other receivables and assets (+$868 million).

Cash and bank balances fell mainly due to capital expenditure (-$1,768 million), redemption of MCBs (-$1,745 million), placement of fixed deposits with original maturity of more than 12 months (-$1,739 million), dividend payment (-$1,429 million), investment and capital injection in Air India Limited (-$996 million), repayment of borrowings (-$736 million). lease payments (-$697 million), repayment of bonds (-$300 million) and interest payments (-$265 million). These were partly offset by net cash generated from operations (+$4,708 million), proceeds from borrowings (+$902 million), proceeds from maturity of fixed deposits with original maturity of more than 12 months (+$766 million) and interest received from investments and deposits (+$481 million).

Total Group liabilities decreased by $503 million (-1.8%) to $27,017 million as at 31 March 2025, primarily arising from a decrease in lease liabilities (-$392 million), derivative liabilities (-$371 million), sales in advance of carriage (-$180 million) and borrowings (-$142 million). These were partially offset by increase in trade and other creditors (+$245 million), deferred revenue (+$233 million) and deferred taxes (+$82 million).

The Group's net debt R1  was $4,138 million as at 31 March 2025, a decrease of $2,465 million from the prior year, attributable to lower cash and bank balances (-$2,999 million), partially offset by lower lease liabilities (+$392 million) and notes payable (+$312 million). Total debt to equity ratio remained constant at 0.82 times as at 31 March 2025.

## GROUP NET DEBT AND NET LIQUID ASSETS

<!-- image -->

- R1 Net debt is defined as the sum of lease liabilities, loans and bonds issued, net of cash and bank balances and short-term investments.

## DIVIDENDS

For the financial year ended 31 March 2025, the Board recommends a final dividend of 30 cents per share. Including the interim dividend of 10 cents per share paid on 11 December 2024, the total dividend for the financial year will be 40 cents per share.

A breakdown of fuel costs is shown below:

|                             | 2024/25 $ million   | 2023/24 $ million   |    |   Change $ million |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----|--------------------|
| Fuel costs (before hedging) | 4,693.7             | 4,657.9             | +  |               35.8 |
| Fuel hedging gains          | (46.2)              | (332.5)             | +  |              286.3 |

Expenditure on fuel before hedging was $36 million higher because of:

|                                                                                  |   $ million |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 10.1% increase in volume uplifted from 31.6 million BBL to 34.8 million BBL      |       491.4 |
| 8.5% decrease in weighted average fuel price from 110.0 USD/BBL to 100.7 USD/BBL |       433.4 |
| Weaker USD against SGD                                                           |        22.2 |

Staff costs increased $163 million (+6.2%) largely due to higher pay and allowances with the increase in staff strength and average pay, as well as higher crew allowances from the expansion of operations.

Depreciation was $179 million (+10.0%) higher, mainly due to the addition of new aircraft and completion of maintenance and overhaul jobs.

Most ex-fuel variable costs increased to support the network expansion and passenger traffic growth, on top of rate increases.

Other costs rose $314 million (+45.3%), primarily due to the swing from a foreign exchange gain last year to a loss this year and provision for Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation obligations.

## FUEL PRODUCTIVITY AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

Fuel productivity of the passenger fleet, measured by load tonne-km per barrel (ltk/BBL) was  473ltk/BBL, almost flat as compared to 471ltk/BBL registered in the previous year.

## FUEL PRODUCTIVITY OF PASSENGER FLEET

<!-- image -->

A change in fuel productivity of 1.0% would have an impact on the FSC's annual fuel costs before hedging of about $44 million, before accounting for changes in fuel price, USD exchange rate and flying operations.

A change in the price of fuel before hedging of one US dollar per barrel affects the FSC's annual fuel cost for passenger fleet by about $43 million, before accounting for USD exchange rate movements, and changes in volume of fuel consumed.

## NET INTEREST INCOME

Net interest income was $73 million, $112 million lower than last year, mainly due to lower interest income from the lower cash and bank balances and interest rates, partially offset by lower interest expense on leases, surplus funds placed by subsidiaries, and bonds.

## DIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARY AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES

Dividends from subsidiary companies were $164 million higher than last year mainly due to dividends received from Silkair (Singapore) Private Limited, and higher dividends from SIA Engineering Company Limited and Singapore Aviation and General Insurance Company Private Limited. These were partially offset by absence of dividends from Tradewinds Tours &amp; Travel Private Limited and lower dividends from Ritz-Carlton Millenia Properties Private Limited.

## GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF AN ASSOCIATED COMPANY

The $602 million gain pertained to the non-cash accounting gain recorded by the FSC following the completion of the Air India-Vistara merger during the year.

## TAXATION

Tax expense decreased $256 million from last year mainly due to lower profitability, the non-taxable gain on disposal of Vistara and higher tax-exempt dividend income, coupled with an overprovision of taxes in prior years.

## PERFORMANCE OF THE SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES

The major subsidiary companies are SIA Engineering and Scoot. The following performance review includes intra-group transactions.

## SIA ENGINEERING

|                   | 2024/25 $ million   | 2023/24 $ million   | %Change   |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Total revenue     | 1,245.1             | 1,094.2             | + 13.8    |
| Total expenditure | (1,230.5)           | (1,091.9)           | + 12.7    |
| Operating profit  | 14.6                | 2.3                 | n.m.      |
| Net profit        | 139.6               | 97.1                | + 43.8    |

The SIAEC Group posted a revenue of $1,245 million for the financial year ended 31 March 2025, up $151 million or 13.8% year-on-year supported by stable growth in demand for aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul services.

Expenditure rose $139 million or 12.7% mainly due to higher material usage and subcontract costs, in line with the rise in work activities.

Consequently, the SIAEC Group recorded an operating profit of $15 million, improving $12 million from the previous year.

Net profit  for  the  financial  year  was  $140  million,  an  increase  of  $43  million  or  43.8%.  On  top  of  the  better  operating performance (+$12 million), the absence of impairment on deferred engine programme recorded last year (+$25 million) and higher share of profits of associated and joint venture companies (+$18 million), which saw similar trend of increase in demand, contributed to the higher net profit.

Basic earnings per share was 12.46 cents for the current financial year.

## SCOOT

|                       | 2024/25 $ million   | 2023/24 $ million   | %Change   |
|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Total revenue         | 2,349.2             | 2,445.5             | - 3.9     |
| Total expenditure     | (2,313.4)           | (2,327.4)           | - 0.6     |
| Operating profit      | 35.8                | 118.1               | - 69.7    |
| Profit after taxation | 22.2                | 182.4               | 87.8 -    |

Revenue for Scoot declined $96 million or 3.9% for the year, on the back of a 3.0% fall in passenger traffic against a flat capacity change, exacerbated by 2.9% weaker yields. Scoot's PLF dipped 2.8% points to 88.4%.

Expenditure decreased marginally by $14 million or 0.6%, as the savings from lower variable costs were offset by higher depreciation expense with new aircraft deliveries and staff costs due to additional headcount.

As a result, Scoot's operating profit was down $82 million to $36 million.

Scoot recorded a profit after taxation of $22 million, a decline of $160 million from last year largely due to the lower operating profit (-$82 million), a tax expense against a tax credit recorded last year (-$74 million) and the absence of gain on disposal on three A320CEOs last year (-$11 million). The tax credit recorded in the prior year stemmed from the recognition of previously unutilised tax losses.

## STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGMENT

## 1.  THE SIA GROUP ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

Since 2002, a formalised Enterprise Risk Management Framework has been implemented across the SIA Group to ensure a sound system is in place to govern, report and manage risks through the application of established risk management principles, policies and guidelines. This framework, which includes various activities involving all levels of staff that run throughout the year, was developed, and is continually reviewed, with the following four key objectives in mind:

- · To facilitate business decision-making, planning and prioritisation, where associated risks are duly identified and assessed in a systemic and consistent manner, and to ensure appropriate controls and risk response strategies are put in place to manage such risks to enable business operations to be carried out safely and efficiently, and safeguard the interests of shareholders, investors and stakeholders in the pursuit of new business opportunities.
- · To ensure sound corporate governance, where there is visibility, clarity and accountability of key risks, and oversight of internal controls to manage and mitigate such risks.
- · To comply with applicable regulations and provide assurance to internal and external stakeholders over the management of key risks.
- · To inculcate a healthy risk-aware culture, where risks are managed proactively and in a coordinated manner, and assessed on an ongoing basis where controls are reviewed and regularly tested for their effectiveness.

Details of the key elements of SIA Enterprise Risk Management Framework can be found on SIA's Website 13 .

## 2.  RISK APPETITE

SIA Group's Risk Appetite Statement describes the Group's attitude and posture in key risk areas and is regularly reviewed to ensure alignment with the Group's strategies and relevance in the prevailing risk landscape.

The Board has approved the Risk Appetite Statement for SIA Group under the following key areas:

## (i) Strategic

The Group pursues diversified network growth between its Singapore hub and key markets for both the full-service and low-cost passenger segments, as well as for the air cargo business, to avoid over-reliance on any single market and provide flexibility to respond effectively to dynamic market conditions. The Group strives to maintain a balanced portfolio of aircraft and engine types to mitigate technology risks, while meeting network needs.

To complement growth in the Singapore hub, the Group pursues opportunities that are deemed value-accretive, which include investments in airlines outside of Singapore and in new businesses, and adopts a prudent approach in managing the associated risks.

## (iii) Operational

The Group is committed to ensuring resilience on all operational fronts, as we strive to consistently deliver a quality experience to our customers, while enhancing operational efficiency through innovation and regular process reviews, with safety and security being the top priority at all times.

## (iv) Information Technology

The Group recognises technology's critical role in maintaining industry leadership. We are committed to ensuring system availability, reliability, and security, while protecting data integrity and complying with applicable regulations. We continuously leverage technology to reinforce our market position and safeguard against associated risks.

## (v) Financial

The Group's airline operations carry certain financial risks, including the effects of changes in jet fuel prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and the market value of our financial investments, as well as credit risks. The Group's overall risk management approach is to moderate the effects of such volatility on its financial performance through the use of derivatives to hedge specific exposures. In terms of liquidity risk, the Group's approach is to ensure that its balance sheet is resilient and that there is access to diverse sources of funding and instruments at all times.

## (vi) Sustainability

The Group strives to provide air transportation services of the highest quality by ensuring that key environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks are regularly reviewed, considered and addressed throughout our business operations and in all strategic decisions. Various programmes are in place to drive and implement sustainable practices across the company. We continue to deepen our efforts to mitigate climate change risks, ensure responsible business practices, build a diverse and inclusive workforce, and give back to people and the communities we operate in.

## (vii) Regulatory

The Group is committed to complying with applicable laws and regulatory requirements and conducting business with integrity, transparency and honesty.

## 3.  RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH

The Risk Management strategy adopted by the SIA Group is based on the three lines defense model, where (i) Business Units (BUs) manage risks in day-to-day operations at the first line, (ii) the Board, Senior Management and dedicated corporate functions provide governance and oversight at the second line and (iii) SIA Internal Audit provides independent assurance at the third line. Correspondingly, the SIA Enterprise Risk Management Framework has been developed in line with this strategy and is regularly reviewed to ensure the Group's risk management practices remain relevant and effective, and continually reinforced through training and active communication to inculcate a healthy risk-aware culture, where risks are reviewed proactively and on an ongoing basis. The following are key highlights of SIA Enterprise Risk Management and related activities in the past year:

## (a) Key Risk Management Activities

## Ongoing Reviews of Risks and Controls

In view of the evolving risk landscape, the review of risks is performed on an ongoing basis through various activities driven by SIA Risk Management Department (RMD), which includes promoting a risk-aware culture where BUs proactively manage risks. Regular reviews are also conducted across levels to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to manage prevailing risks, as well as identify new and emerging risks for proactive management. Key risk topics, including areas of emerging risks, were scheduled throughout the year for review by the various Risk Committees at Company, Group and Board levels,  in addition to regular reporting of risk management indicators and incidents, including the learnings and follow-up actions, to ensure oversight. The group-wide Annual Risk Management Review Exercise (ARMRE), a bottom-up review and reporting of key risks across all business functions was conducted. Complementing ARMRE is the Control Self-Assessment (CSA) conducted as a formal exercise annually where BUs validated the controls in place to manage key risks surfaced through ARMRE. The outcome of these exercises were reported to the Board Safety and Risk Management Committee (BSRC), and where risks cut across various functions and are interdependent, the BSRC also coordinated the review of these risks and the distribution of relevant risks to other Board Committees for oversight.

## STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGMENT (Continued)

## Simulation Tests on Crisis Management and Business Continuity Plans

To ensure the efficacy of the Group's resilience towards business disruptions from unplanned events, including potential large-scale disruptions, business continuity plans (BCPs) and other risk response plans are in place, regularly reviewed and tested. Where relevant, multiple stakeholders, vendors and outsourced service providers are involved in the BCP reviews and tests to ensure coordination and alignment of responsibilities and communication flow across various functions. SIA RMD maintains a schedule to ensure due completion of BCP test exercises and performs independent verification of these tests. The BCP tests scheduled for 2024 were completed and the outcomes of each test verified by SIA RMD were reported to the BSRC for oversight.

## Training and Communications

A comprehensive plan is in place to reach out to all employees through targeted communications and engagement activities to promote risk awareness and cross-sharing of risk management best practices. An interactive webbased training mandatory for all employees is also in place, as continual training is another key element to equip our employees with the relevant knowledge and the right mindset to manage risks. Risk management resources, including manuals and guidelines are regularly updated and accessible to all employees to encourage independent and proactive management of risks in day-to-day operations.

## (b) Health and Safety Risks

With the safety of our passengers and employees being a top priority, the Group has in place a robust safety management framework and actively promotes a culture of safety awareness, values and consciousness among our staff. Safety performance and incidents, including learnings from external events, are regularly reviewed by the SIA Occupational Safety &amp; Health Committee (OSH), which comprises senior staff members from various key operational functions across the SIA Group, and surfaced to the BSRC, to ensure that we consistently reinforce and uphold our safety standards.

## (c) Sustainability and Climate-related Risks

As part of our efforts to comply with specific requirements in line with the mandate by the Singapore Exchange Limited (SGX) to disclose climate-related risks and opportunities, besides engagements with BUs to increase awareness and enhance staff competency in assessing climate-related factors and their impact to business operations, a dedicated climate risk register is in place to enhance oversight and reporting of climate-related risks. In addition, climate-related factors were also considered for relevant key risk topics that were surfaced for review by Senior Management and the Board through scheduled risk review presentations to the various risk committees. This will continue to be a key area of focus for the Group.

## (d) Information Technology and Cybersecurity Risks

With increasing reliance on technology and cybersecurity threats continuing to be a menace to business operations, we consistently conduct thorough reviews on cybersecurity risk exposures and close monitoring of trends to ensure the Group's agility in adapting and strengthening controls to counter the evolving IT security threats and organised cybercrimes. To assess the Group's preparedness in responding to a cyber-attack and the recovery capabilities of critical IT systems, regular cyber incident and disaster recovery drills are conducted. In addition, SIA Information Security employs continuous monitoring tools to assess potential vulnerabilities and identify areas to bolster the Group's cybersecurity infrastructure. With active adoption of new technologies such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) across the Group, an AI Governance and Risk Management Framework has also been developed to effectively track, manage and report associated risks. The Group continues to remain vigilant of risk exposures and ensure that they are appropriately addressed. The SIA Board and Senior Management are actively involved in the governance and oversight of IT and Cybersecurity risks through the various reporting and review forums.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The Board and Management are committed to continually enhancing long term shareholder value by maintaining high standards  of  corporate  governance,  professionalism,  integrity  and  commitment  at  all  levels,  underpinned  by  strong internal controls and risk management systems.

This Report sets out the Company's corporate governance processes, practices and activities with specific reference to the principles and provisions of the revised Code of Corporate Governance issued by the Ministry of Finance in Singapore in  August 2018 (the 'Code'), which is applicable to this report. The Company's corporate governance processes and activities have complied in all material aspects with the principles and provisions of the Code.

## BOARD MATTERS THE BOARD'S CONDUCT OF AFFAIRS (PRINCIPLE 1)

## Board's Role

The Company is headed by an effective Board which oversees its business performance and affairs, and provides guidance to Management to ensure its long-term success. The Board's principal functions include charting the Group's strategic direction, guiding Management on its ongoing transformation efforts (including digitalisation, technology and innovation), reviewing  and  approving  annual  budgets  and  financial  plans,  monitoring  the  Group's  performance,  approving  major transactions (including acquisitions and disposals) and fund-raising exercises, and reviewing sustainability and material issues.

The Board actively engages Management, constructively challenges them and holds them accountable for the Company's performance. Material items which require Board approval include the first quarter and third quarter business updates, the half-year and full-year financial results, the general remuneration framework for Relevant Key Management Personnel 14 , etc.

Board Directors lead Management by example, regarding themselves as fiduciaries who act objectively in the best interests of the Company, thereby setting the appropriate tone-from-the-top and desired organisational culture. In this regard, the Board's duties include reviewing the appropriateness of the risk management and compliance framework as part of ensuring compliance with laws and industry standards material to the business, and approving the risk appetite statements in relation to various key areas concerning the Company and the Group. Where there is an actual or potential conflict of interest facing a Director, he or she recuses himself or herself, or abstains from voting.

## Delegation by the Board

In  the  discharge  of  its  functions,  the  Board  is  supported  by  six  committees  to  which  it  delegates  specific  areas  of responsibilities for reviewing and/or decision making. The Board committees play an important role in ensuring good corporate governance. All six Board committees are constituted with clear written terms of reference setting out their compositions, authorities and duties, including reporting back to the Board. Each of these committees assists the Board in the discharge of its oversight function and is actively engaged, with the Chairmen of each committee reporting significant matters discussed and/or approved by the committee regularly to the Board, pursuant to the relevant committee's charter.

The Group has established financial authorisation and approval limits for operating and capital expenditures, procurement of goods and services, and acquisition and disposal of investments. These limits and procedures are communicated in writing to relevant departments. Pursuant to these written procedures, the Board approves transactions that exceed the applicable materiality thresholds, while delegating authority for transactions below such threshold limits to the Board Executive Committee and/or Management to optimise operational efficiency.

- 14 Relevant Key Management Personnel are employees holding the rank of Executive Vice President and above. For FY2024/25, they comprised the CEO and two Executive Vice Presidents.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (Continued)

## Board Meetings

During the financial year, the Board held four scheduled meetings. It will hold ad hoc meetings as and when warranted by particular circumstances. The Board also holds separate Strategy Sessions to further guide Management in developing its plans and strategies for the future. An off-site Board Strategy Session was held in the financial year.

Schedules of Board Meetings and Strategy Sessions are circulated to the Directors prior to the start of the financial year to allow Directors to plan ahead for their attendance at these events. Board and board committee meeting attendance via telephone and video conferencing is allowed under the Company's Constitution.

A record of the Directors' attendance at Board and Board committee meetings during the financial year is set out on page 94. Directors who are unable to attend a Board meeting or Board committee meeting are provided with the agenda and papers in advance, and can discuss issues relating to the matters to be raised at  the  meeting  with  other  Board members and/or Management.

## Access to Information

Board Directors are provided with papers in advance of each Board Meeting and Strategy Session, to enable them to be properly informed of matters to be discussed and/or approved. Board and board committees papers are provided electronically and can be accessed via tablet devices. Board papers contain both regular items such as reports on the Company  and  its  subsidiaries  and  associated  companies,  updates  on  business  development,  monthly  management accounts, and productivity and performance indicators, as well as matters for the decision or information of the Board.

Board Directors have separate and independent access to Senior Management 15  and the Company Secretary at all times. The Company Secretary attends the Board meetings and prepares minutes of the Board proceedings. He assists with the proper functioning of the Board, including compliance with the Company's Constitution, the Companies Act, the Securities and Futures Act and the SGX-ST Listing Manual. He ensures that all material information is provided to the Board in a timely manner. The Company Secretary is legally trained and experienced in company secretarial practices. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is subject to the Board's approval.

Directors can seek independent professional advice if required. The cost of such advice will be borne by the Company.

## Newly Appointed Directors

To assist newly appointed Board Directors to understand the Company's business and their directorship duties, Management briefs them on the Company's business and strategic directions, as well as governance practices. The Company conducts orientation programmes for new Board Directors, including site visits to the Company's main centres of operations such as the aircraft hangars and training facilities for cabin crew and pilots. Relevant material is also provided, including a set of policy and guidelines on dealings in securities and a memorandum on directors' duties and liabilities. Formal letters are issued to new Board Directors upon their appointment, setting out details of their duties and obligations as Directors. The Board Directors, including newly appointed Directors, are subject to the requirements of the Code.

Subsequent trainings and updates for the Directors are described in the section on 'Board Nominating Committee ('NC')' under Principles 4 and 5.

- 15 Senior Management are employees holding the rank of Senior Vice President and above. For FY2024/25, they comprised the CEO, two Executive Vice Presidents and 10 Senior Vice Presidents.

## BOARD COMPOSITION AND GUIDANCE (PRINCIPLE 2)

## Board Size and Composition

The Board currently comprises ten Directors as follows:

| Nameof Director        | Position held on the Board   | Date of first appointment to the Board   | Date of last re-election as Director   | Nature of Appointment          |

| Simon Cheong Sae Peng  | Director                     | 1 June 2017                              | 29 July 2024                           | Non-executive/ Independent     |
| David John Gledhill    | Director                     | 1 September 2018                         | 26 July 2022                           | Non-executive/ Independent     |
| Goh Swee Chen          | Director                     | 1 January 2019                           | 29 July 2024                           | Non-executive/ Independent     |

The size and composition of the Board are reviewed by the Nominating Committee at each of its four meetings throughout the year, taking into account the scope of the business, nature of operations and changing needs of the Group over time. In its review, the Nominating Committee seeks to ensure that the size and composition of the Board is adequate to provide for a diversity of thought and background to facilitate effective decision-making, and that the Board has an appropriate balance of executive, independent and non-independent Directors.

## Board Diversity Policy

Singapore  Airlines  has  a  Board  Diversity  policy.  Under  this  policy,  the  Board  is  committed  towards  building  diversity amongst  its  members,  taking  care  to  select  and  appoint  suitably  qualified  and/or  well-experienced  persons  in  their respective fields of expertise, as Directors regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, nationality, religion or other dimensions of diversity. The Board believes that diversity is not only limited to a person's age, gender or individual characteristics. Instead, Board diversity is multi-faceted in nature, with different dimensions varying from time to time, depending on the prevailing environment and future needs of the business. As a result, the Board's diversity characteristics and composition will change over time to adapt to evolving business challenges, opportunities, and cycles. In view of this, the main target of the Board Diversity policy is to strike an appropriate balance of perspectives, experience and expertise on the Board as a whole, so that with the benefit of diverse views, the Board can be effective in decision-making to support the long-term success of Singapore Airlines.

To ensure that the Board continues to provide the necessary range of perspectives, experience and expertise for the benefit of the Company, the Nominating Committee considers diversity criteria, amongst other relevant criteria as part of its director candidate selection and nomination pursuant to the Board Diversity policy. Such objective criteria include core and complementary industry experience, as well as professional and management skillsets. The Nominating Committee considers the main target of the Board Diversity policy to have been met, as the Board collectively comprises Directors who come from diverse industry and professional backgrounds with varied expertise in finance, accounting/audit, legal, technology, human resource, sustainability, business, marketing and management fields. Their profiles are found on pages 12 to 15 and 95 to 100.

<!-- image -->

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (Continued)

Specifically in support of gender diversity under the policy, the Nominating Committee ensures that appropriate efforts are made to include suitable female candidates in the identification of potential directors, when reviewing the optimum composition and balance of the Board. As part of its diversity initiatives, the Board has two female Directors, one of whom is on the Nominating Committee. The policy target, introduced in FY2022/23, is to increase the female Board representation to 30% within the timeline leading up to 2030, whilst striving to maintain a minimum of two female directors on the Board.

Other elements of diversity considered by the Nominating Committee in line with the policy include the geographic exposure of the Board as a whole, as a broad reflection of the Company's cross-border business. This aspect of diversity is  not  only  a  function  of  the  Board  Directors'  experience  gained  in  other  countries  or  multi-national  companies,  but also includes their personal attributes such as nationality and ethnicity. In this regard, the Board comprises two foreign nationals,  a  Caucasian  and  an  Indian  by  ethnicity.  The  Nominating  Committee  considers  this  aspect  of  diversity  by geographic exposure, ethnicity and/or nationality to have been satisfied in the Company's circumstances, as a majority Singaporean Board is needed to comply with aero-regulatory requirements applicable to the Company, being the holder of a Singapore Air Operator Certificate.

The Board values the importance of being well-balanced and effective through ensuring a diversity of views under the Board Diversity policy. With this aim in mind, the Board will continue to build on the element of diversity. The Board's diversity efforts have been recognised by the Securities Investors Association of Singapore ('SIAS'). At the SIAS Investors' Choice  Awards  in  October  2022,  Singapore  Airlines  had  the  honour  to  be  named  the  runner-up  for  the  Singapore Corporate Governance Award under the 'Diversity' category.

## Board Independence

The Board, taking into account the views of the Nominating Committee, assesses the independence of each Director annually  in  accordance  with  the  definition  under  the  Code,  namely  that  an  'independent'  Director  is  one  who  is independent in conduct, character and judgement, and has no relationship with the Company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the Director's independent business judgement in the best interests of the Company.

Based on the above definition, all the independence requirements under the provisions of the Code, as applicable to the relevant Board committees, have been met. In addition, the Board has well exceeded the minimum independence target  set  by  Rule  210(5)(c)  of  the  SGX-ST  Listing  Manual,  namely  that  at  least  one-third  of  its  members  have  to  be independent. In this regard, there is a strong majority of independent Board Directors, with the Board considering eight Directors, including the Chairman, out of ten Board members to be independent. In particular, these eight Directors are considered to be independent from Management and the Company's substantial shareholders, namely Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Napier Investments Pte. Ltd. and Tembusu Capital Pte. Ltd. (together, 'Temasek').

The two non-independent Directors are Mr Goh Choon Phong and Mr Gautam Banerjee. Mr Goh is the Chief Executive Officer ('CEO') and sole executive Director of the Company. All of the other nine Board members are non-executive Directors, who make up a majority on the Board.

Amongst the nine non-executive Directors is one non-independent Director, Mr Gautam Banerjee. Having served for more than nine years on the Board, Mr Banerjee was re-designated as a non-independent Director with effect from 1 January 2022 by the automatic operation of the '9-year rule' under the then prevailing Rule 210(5)(d)(iii) (since superceded by Rule 210(5)(d)(iv)) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual (which took effect from 1 January 2022). The Board believes that the continued appointment of Mr Banerjee (who has, over time, gained valuable insights into the Company and accumulated vast institutional knowledge) as a non-independent Director is especially critical for continuity in view of the Company's investment in India.

The non-executive Directors, led by the independent Chairman, set aside time, at least once a year, to meet without the presence of Management to review the latter's performance in meeting goals and objectives, or to discuss any other relevant matters. Relevant feedback from such meetings is communicated to Management. Feedback is also provided by each Director in a formal Board Evaluation Questionnaire conducted annually. The feedback is compiled in a report to the Nominating Committee and the Board for review. All Directors have demonstrated objectivity in their deliberations in the best interests of the Company.

## CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (PRINCIPLE 3)

The Chairman, Mr Peter Seah, and the CEO, Mr Goh Choon Phong, are not related to each other. There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the CEO, with different authority limits set out in writing for various matters. No one individual has unfettered powers of decision-making. This ensures a balance of power within the Company, as well as increases accountability and greater capacity of the Board for independent decision-making.

The Chairman leads the Board and is responsible for its workings and proceedings. He plays a crucial role in fostering constructive dialogue amongst shareholders, the Board and Management. The Chairman leads the Company's drive to achieve and maintain a high standard of corporate governance with the full support of the Directors, Management and Company Secretary.

The CEO, assisted by the Management Committee, makes strategic proposals to the Board and oversees the execution of the Board's decisions. He also oversees the execution of the Company's corporate and business strategies and policies, and the conduct of its business.

## BOARD MEMBERSHIP (PRINCIPLE 4) BOARD PERFORMANCE (PRINCIPLE 5)

## Board Committees

The six Board committees formed to assist the Board in the execution of its responsibilities are:

- · Board Executive Committee,
- · Board Audit Committee,
- · Board Compensation and Industrial Relations Committee,
- · Board Nominating Committee,
- · Board Safety and Risk Committee and
- · Customer Experience, Technology and Sustainability Committee.

Each Board committee's work pursuant to its written terms of reference (the 'Charter') is described briefly below. The Charters are reviewed periodically and updated as necessary.

## (A) Board Executive Committee ('ExCo')

The members of the ExCo are Mr Peter Seah (Chairman), Mr Goh Choon Phong, Mr Gautam Banerjee and Mr Yeoh Oon Jin. Under its Charter, the ExCo's main responsibility is overseeing the execution by Management of the overall strategy, policies, directions and guidelines set by the Board for the SIA Group. The ExCo's duties also include reviewing and making recommendations to the Board on proposed transactions above a certain materiality threshold and matters relating to the Group's wholly-owned subsidiaries. The ExCo is authorised to approve transactions up to a designated materiality threshold and to make decisions on routine financial, operational and administrative matters. The ExCo also functions as the Share Buy Back Committee of the Company.

## (B) Board Audit Committee ('AC')

The AC comprises Mr Yeoh Oon Jin (Chairman), Mr Gautam Banerjee, Mr Dominic Ho, Ms Goh Swee Chen and Ms Jeanette Wong. Four out of five members of the AC are independent Directors. All the AC members are non-executive Directors. The role and responsibilities of the AC under its Charter are described in the section on 'Audit Committee' (Principle 10) as shown on pages 90 to 92.

## (C) Board Safety and Risk Committee ('BSRC')

The members of the BSRC are Mr Dominic Ho (Chairman), Mr Peter Seah, Mr Lee Kim Shin and Mr David Gledhill. All members of the BSRC are independent non-executive Directors. Under its Charter, the functions of the BSRC include ensuring that systems and programmes in the Group comply with regulatory requirements and are in accordance with the best practices of the aviation industry; reviewing regular reports on safety performances; reviewing accident investigation findings and recommendations; and advising Management and reporting to the Board on safety issues.

<!-- image -->

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (Continued)

The BSRC also oversees the risk governance framework and risk management system, including reviewing key risks and controls put in place by Management. This is further described in the section on 'Risk Management and Internal Controls' (Principle 9) as shown on pages 89 to 90.

## (D) Board Nominating Committee ('NC')

The members of the NC are Mr Peter Seah (Chairman), Mr Lee Kim Shin and Ms Goh Swee Chen. All members of the NC are independent non-executive Directors.

## (D1) Appointment and Re-election of Directors

Under its Charter, the NC's responsibilities and duties include considering and making recommendations to the Board concerning the appointment and re-election of Directors, and determining the independence of the Directors. The NC's recommendations are based on a review of the range of expertise, skills and attributes of current Board members and the needs of the Board, taking into account the Company's future business direction, the tenure of service, as well as the contribution and commitment of each Board member. Board rejuvenation is a guiding principle in determining the need for new appointees to the Board.

With regard to the selection of new Directors, the NC evaluates the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and, arising from such evaluation, determines the role and the desirable competencies for a particular appointment to enhance the existing Board composition, taking into account diversity criteria. At least one member of the NC meets with the short-listed Board candidates in person or via video/audio-only call to assess their suitability and availability. The NC then makes recommendations to the Board for approval.

Newly appointed Directors serve an initial term of three years, after which they may be considered for nomination for re-election for another term(s). Their nominations are subject to the recommendations of the NC.

The Company's Constitution provides that at each Annual General Meeting of the Company, one-third of the Directors for the time being, or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, then the number nearest to but not less than one-third are required to retire from office and are eligible for re-election. Retiring Directors are selected on the basis of those who have been longest in office since their last re-election, failing which they shall be selected by agreement. The CEO, in his capacity as a Board Director, is also subject to retirement and re-election in accordance with the Constitution of the Company.

New Directors appointed in the year are subject to retirement and re-election by shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting after their appointment. All new appointments and re-elections require the approval of the Special Member, the Minister for Finance.

## (D2) Evaluation of Board Performance

For  FY2024/25,  the  NC  had  commissioned  a  formal  evaluation  of  the  Board  and  its  board  committees,  conducted independently by an external consultant. The process involved gathering feedback from the Directors via questionnaires, with the option for one-on-one interviews to elicit deeper insights. The questionnaire included both numerical scorings and the flexibility to provide qualitative feedback on a variety of topics, including oversight of the organisation's impact on the economy, environment and people. The performance of individual Directors was reviewed by the Chairman and the NC, while the Chairman's performance was reviewed by the rest of the Board. Based on the feedback and insights gathered, the external consultant's report confirmed that the Board and its board committees were functioning effectively and performing well, within a highly competitive and challenging environment. The NC reviewed the consultant's board evaluation report and discussed the appropriate actions in response to the evaluation.

## (D3) Directors' Commitment

The  NC  has  reviewed  the  contribution  by  the  Directors  individually,  taking  into  account  their  listed  company  board representations and other principal commitments. The NC and the Board are of the view that setting a maximum number of listed company board representations a Director should have, is not meaningful, as the contribution of each Director would depend on the Director's individual circumstances, including whether he or she has a full time vocation or other responsibilities. Notwithstanding the number of listed company board representations and other principal commitments which the Directors held, the NC was of the view that they were able to devote sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Company.

## (D4) Directors' Training

Under its Charter, the NC's responsibilities include reviewing the training and professional development programmes for  the  Board,  whether  for  new  or  existing  Directors.  Board  Directors  understand  the  Company's  business  and  their directorship duties (including their roles as executive, non-executive, independent and non-independent Directors). They are provided with opportunities to develop and maintain their skills and knowledge at the Company's expense. All Board members have completed one of the sustainability courses prescribed by SGX-ST.

Board meetings may include presentations by senior executives, external experts and industry leaders on strategic issues relating to specific business areas. For FY2024/25, Board members attended briefings on opportunities and threats in the aero-political environment, the global aviation industry, the Group portfolio strategy (comprising both airline and non-airline businesses), SIA's investment in India as part of its multi-hub strategy, and other related topics. Guest speakers included a professor of aviation law from the National University of Singapore, as well as senior executives of a global bank and a large travel agency.

A Director without prior experience as a director of an issuer listed on SGX-ST is also required to attend training programmes conducted by the Singapore Institute of Directors on the roles and responsibilities of directors, as prescribed by SGX-ST.

## (E) Board Compensation and Industrial Relations Committee ('BCIRC')

The BCIRC is chaired by Mr Peter Seah, and comprises Mr Simon Cheong and Ms Jeanette Wong. All members of the BCIRC are independent non-executive Directors.

In accordance with its responsibilities and duties under its Charter, the BCIRC reviews and recommends for the Board's approval the general framework of remuneration for the Board and Relevant Key Management Personnel. The BCIRC also recommends the specific remuneration packages for each Director and Relevant Key Management Personnel and administers the Company's Profit Sharing Bonus ('PSB'), EVA-based Incentive Plan ('EBIP'), Performance Share Plan ('PSP'), Restricted Share Plan ('RSP') and Strategic Share Award ('SSA') for Senior Management. The award of shares to Senior Management is based on organisational and individual performance. The BCIRC retains and may exercise discretion when determining the link amongst remuneration, performance and value creation. Professional advice is sought by the BCIRC, as it deems necessary, in the development and execution of the remuneration plan for the Company's Senior Management. For FY2024/25, Carrots Consulting Pte Ltd was engaged as a remuneration consultant to provide professional advice on human resource matters. The principal consultant providing such services was Mr Johan Grundlingh. Carrots Consulting only provides remuneration consulting services to the Company, and has no other relationship with the Company.

Leadership development and succession planning in the Company remain a key focus for the BCIRC. The Company has in place an annual review of high potential executives, to ensure an adequate pipeline for succession planning in key management positions. Such high potential executives will be given exposure to key jobs in the organisation, as part of their career development.

The Company continues to put much emphasis on maintaining harmonious industrial relations and in this regard, the BCIRC plays an important role in providing appropriate guidance to Management. The Company's three unions, namely AESU representing the Executives, ALPA-S representing the Pilots, and SIASU representing the Associates and Cabin Crew, hold regular meetings with Management and Chairman of BCIRC.

## (F) Customer Experience, Technology and Sustainability Committee ('CETSC')

The members of the CETSC are Mr Simon Cheong (Chairman), Mr David Gledhill, Ms Goh Swee Chen and Mr Goh Choon Phong. With the exception of Mr Goh, all the members of the CETSC are non-executive Directors.

The CETSC, formerly known as the Customer Experience and Technology Committee, was formed in January 2019 to provide more focus on enhancing the Company's customer experience. Subsequently in February 2020, this committee was  renamed  as  the  Customer  Experience,  Technology  and  Sustainability  Committee.  This  reflects  the  committee's expanded role in overseeing sustainability matters, as delegated by the Board.

Under its Charter, the CETSC provides advice and guidance to enhance the customer experience of the business by focusing on the development of products, policies, processes and people skills. Digitalisation, technology and innovation may also be explored to drive the customer experience enhancement. Further, under its Charter, the CETSC exercises oversight as well as provides advice and guidance on the overall strategic roadmap for sustainability.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (Continued)

## Remuneration Mix

SIA's remuneration mix for Senior Management comprises salary, variable components and benefits. Variable components comprise short-term and long-term incentives, which are dependent on Group, Company and individual performance. The remuneration mix aims to provide a good balance between competitiveness with the market, as well as rewards for short-term and long-term objectives.

## Fixed Component for Senior Management ('Salary')

The  fixed  component  comprises  Base  Salary  and  the  Annual  Wage  Supplement  ('AWS').  The  fixed  components  are benchmarked to comparable positions in the market, and reflect the market worth of the positions.

## Variable Components for Senior Management

## (A) Cash Incentive Plans ('Bonuses')

This comprises the following components:

## (A1) Performance Target Bonus ("PTB")

The PTB rewards Key Executives for delivering on financial and operation objectives, as well as strategic development of the Group. The PTB is targeted at three times the monthly base salary of each Key Executive incumbent, and final payout is based on assessment of the Individual Performance Scorecard (IPS) of each Key Executive incumbent. An IPS rating is subsequently used to modify the PTB payout within the range of 0 - 150%.

Individual performance objectives aligned to the overall strategic, financial and operational goals of the Company are set at the beginning of each financial year and are cascaded down to a select group of key Senior Management staff using Individual Performance Scorecards, creating alignment between the performance of the Group, Company and the individual. While these performance objectives and weightages are different for each executive, they are assessed on the same principles across the following four broad categories of targets:

- · Financial and Business
- · Customer and Operations
- · People and Organisational Development
- · Transformation and Strategic Projects

The FY2024/25 Individual Performance Scorecard categories include financial and operational drivers weighted 50% and strategic initiatives weighted the other 50% and the results are subject to the BCIRC/Board's discretion at the end of the financial year. ESG metrics as set out in our Key Value Drivers ('KPIs') are also included in the Individual Performance Scorecards.

## (A2) Economic Value Added ('EVA')-based Incentive Plan ('EBIP')

The  EBIP  rewards  for  sustainable  shareholder  value  creation  over  the  medium-term  achieved  by  growing  profits, deploying capital efficiently and managing the risk profile and risk time horizon of an airline business. A portion of the annual performance-related bonus of key Senior Management is tied to the EVA achieved by the Group. Under the plan, one-third of the accumulated EBIP, comprising the EBIP declared in respect of the financial year and the balance of such bonus brought forward from preceding years (which comprises incentive amounts retained over multiple years in the EBIP Bank Balance), is paid out in cash each year. The remaining two-thirds are carried forward in the individual executive's EBIP Bank Balance. Amounts in the EBIP Bank Balance are at risk because any negative EBIP declared will result in an offset against the current EBIP Bank Balance. This mechanism encourages key Senior Management to work for sustainable EVA and to adopt strategies that are aligned with the long term interests of the Group.

In determining the final EBIP payouts, the BCIRC considers overall Group performance and relevant market remuneration benchmarks.

The rules of the EBIP are subject to review by the BCIRC, which has the discretion, under the authority of the Board, to amend the rules where appropriate and relevant to the business conditions.

The  BCIRC  had  recommended  and  the  Board  had  approved  the  suspension  of  new  EBIP  funding  for  FY2020/21  to FY2022/23 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the airline industry. This suspension has been renewed until the end of FY2024/25 by the Board based on the BCIRC's recommendation to review upon a full recovery of the Company and will be revisited thereafter based on prevailing market conditions.

## (A3) Value Creation Plan ('VCP')

VCP is an interim incentive until FY2024/25 subject to the Board's discretion to motivate Senior Management to restore the  Company to profitability.  Under  the  plan,  a  percentage  of  positive  Group  NOPAT  will  be  shared  with  the  Senior Management subject to a funding cap. Payout will be made after the end of each financial year.

For FY2024/25, a VCP pool has been generated due to the sustained performance of SIA and allocated by the Board based on the recommendation of the BCIRC. Given the available funding, a portion of VCP funding allocated to each member of Senior Management has been applied to an individual incentive bank with a percentage of the bank paid out to the incumbent each year. The remaining individual incentive bank balances will be carried forward to the following year for future payouts.

## (B) Share Incentive Plans

This comprises the following:

## (B1) The SIA Performance Share Plan 2014 ('PSP 2014')

The PSP 2014 is a share-based incentive scheme established with the objective of rewarding, motivating, and retaining a select group of key Senior Management staff who shoulder the responsibility for the Group's performance and who are able to drive the growth of the Group through innovation, creativity and superior performance. Awards under the PSP 2014 are performance-based, with stretched targets.

Under the PSP 2014, an initial award is made in the form of rights to shares, provided performance targets are met. Annual awards are made based on individual performance of Senior Management staff. The final award, which can vary between 0% to 200% of the initial award, depends on stretched value-aligned performance targets. The targets are based on absolute and relative Total Shareholder Return ('TSR') targets to be met over the performance period of three financial years (with equal weightage). The absolute TSR is based on outperformance against Cost of Equity. The relative TSR is based on outperformance of a selected peer group of leading full service carriers as decided by the BCIRC. For FY2024/25 PSP, a third performance measure on carbon emissions reduction (absolute scope 1 emissions) was added to support SIA's target of reducing emissions to be achieved by the end of 2030 from base year 2019. These performance measures are intended to reflect key drivers of long-term shareholder wealth creation and to support SIA's ESG strategy.

The final award will cliff vest after completion of the performance period.

An initial award of FY2024/25 PSP was granted during the financial year under consideration in July 2024.

Due to the sustained performance of SIA's share price relative to peer airlines, the Group attained an achievement factor that  exceeded  the  pre-determined  target  performance  level  for  the  PSP  awards  granted  in  FY2022/23,  covering  the performance period from FY 2022/23 to FY2024/25. These shares will cliff vest accordingly in July 2025.

## (B2) The SIA Restricted Share Plan 2014 ('RSP 2014')

The RSP 2014 is targeted at a broader base of selected employees and enhances the Company's ability to recruit and retain talented employees, as well as to reward for Group, Company and individual performance. To retain these employees, an extended vesting period of a further two years is imposed beyond the initial one-year performance period.

Under the RSP 2014, an initial award is made in the form of rights to shares, provided performance conditions are met in  future.  Annual  grants  are  made based on position level and individual performance of the key executives selected to participate in the RSP 2014. Final awards may vary between 0% to 150% of the initial award based on the Company Operational Performance Scorecard ('COPS') for FY2024/25. The performance measures are selected as they are aligned with annual financial and operational initiatives focused on cost management, operational metrics and revenue ramp-up. The final  award  is  subject  to  extended  vesting,  with  one-third  of  the  final  award  vesting  at  the  end  of  the  one-year performance period, and the balance to be vested equally over the next two years.

An initial award of FY2024/25 RSP was granted during the financial year under consideration in July 2024.

Due to the sustained performance of SIA for FY2024/25, the Group has attained an achievement factor which is reflective of achieving the pre-determined target performance level for the FY2024/25 RSP awards granted based on the performance period of FY2024/25 only and shares will commence vesting accordingly. Previous final awards of RSP continued to vest during the financial year.

<!-- image -->

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (Continued)

## (B3) Strategic Share Award ('SSA')

To motivate and reward for strategic growth following the COVID pandemic, the Strategic Share Award under the RSP 2014 has been implemented. It is established with the objective of rewarding, motivating and retaining a select group of Senior Management staff throughout the COVID recovery period. SSA is currently planned to be phased out in FY 2025/26.

Under the 5 th  SSA, an initial award was granted in July 2024 in the form of rights to shares taking into account Senior Management's efforts with regards to the post-COVID operating environment and performance for FY2023/24 as assessed by the BCIRC.

The 6 th SSA for FY2024/25 supports the three financial year strategic plan and will be granted in July 2025.

Under the SSA, 50% of the final award vests upon grant and the balance vests in equal tranches over the next two years. An additional 20% equity kicker is awarded upon final vesting for retention purposes.

## (B4) Share Plan Mandates

## 2014 Share Plans

Under the PSP 2014 and RSP 2014, the total number of shares which may be delivered (whether in the form of shares or cash in lieu of shares) is subject to a maximum limit of 5% of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares). In addition, the total number of shares under awards to be granted under the PSP 2014 and RSP 2014 from the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to the next Annual General Meeting (the 'Relevant Year') shall not exceed 0.5% of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares) from time to time (the 'Yearly Limit').

## 2024 Share Plans

At the last Annual General Meeting held on 29 July 2024, shareholders have approved a new RSP 2024 and PSP 2024 Share Plan Mandate, which will apply to awards granted from July 2025 onwards. Details of the PSP 2024 and RSP 2024 can be found in the Directors' Statement on pages 105 to 108.

## Share Ownership Guideline for Senior Management

Senior Management are required to hold a portion of the shares released to them under a share ownership guideline which requires them to maintain a beneficial ownership stake in the Company, thus further aligning their interests with shareholders.

## Compensation Risk Assessment

Under the Practice  Guidance,  the  compensation  system  should  take  into  account  the  risk  policies  of  the  Company, be symmetric with risk outcomes and be sensitive to the time horizon of risks. The BCIRC has reviewed the various compensation risks that may arise and introduced mitigating policies to better manage risk exposures identified. The BCIRC will also undertake periodic reviews of the compensation-related risks in future.

## Pay-for-Performance Alignment

In performing the duties as required under its Charter, the BCIRC ensures that remuneration paid to the CEO and Relevant Key Management Personnel is strongly linked to the achievement of business and individual performance targets.

The performance targets as determined by the BCIRC are set at realistic yet stretched levels each year to motivate a high degree of business performance with emphasis on both short-term and long-term quantifiable objectives.

A pay-for-performance alignment study was conducted by the appointed external remuneration consultant and reviewed by the BCIRC. From a performance standpoint, assessments from multiple perspectives were undertaken, including short term versus long term, absolute versus relative, stock market-based (e.g. share price and TSR) versus internal financial and the role of other strategic, operational and customer-related objectives, and it was concluded that there was sufficient evidence indicating pay-for-performance alignment for the Group in both absolute and relative terms, against a peer group of large listed airline companies for the six-year period from FY2018/19 to FY2023/24.

## Non-executive Directors' Fees

As  approved  by  the  shareholders  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  in  July  2020,  Non-executive  Directors  will  receive approximately 70% of the total directors' fees in cash and approximately 30% of the total directors' fees in the form of restricted shares, which are now governed by the terms of RSP 2024.

As the restricted shares are granted in lieu of directors' remuneration in cash, the shares will be granted outright as fully paid  shares  with  no  performance  conditions  attached  and  no  vesting  periods  imposed.  To  encourage  the  alignment of  interests  with  the  interests  of  shareholders,  Non-executive  Directors  are  required  to  hold  shares  (including  shares obtained by other means) worth a minimum of the annual basic retainer fees (currently $90,000) as the shares, paid out to them as part of their remuneration in lieu of cash, accumulate over time.

A Non-executive Director who steps down before the date of payment of his share component will receive all Directors' fees (calculated on a pro-rated basis, where applicable) in cash. A Non-executive Director who steps down from the Board may sell all SIA shares one year after leaving the Board.

The Non-executive Directors' total fees in respect of FY2024/25 amounted to $2,360,000 [FY2024/25: $2,392,721] and were based on the following rates:

The BCIRC and the Board have reviewed the market competitiveness of the total compensation packages of the CEO and EVPs against market peers in Singapore and Non-US global airlines peers in deciding on the final total compensation outcomes for FY2024/25. The market peers include other large listed companies in Singapore as well as other Non-US global full-service carriers and the information is extracted from recent annual reports of these listed peers. The resulting compensation packages for the CEO and EVPs reflect the size of SIA and takes into account the sustained performance delivered relative to these listed peers in FY2024/25. The BCIRC and the Board are of the view that the resulting market competitiveness for the CEO and EVPs is appropriate and not excessive given the efforts and dedication of the Senior Management in managing the airline in a post-COVID world.

For FY2024/25, the aggregate total remuneration paid to the Relevant Key Management Personnel (who are not the CEO) amounted to $8,903,311.

For FY2024/25, there were no termination, retirement or post-employment benefits granted to Directors, the CEO and Relevant Key Management Personnel other than the standard contractual notice period termination payment in lieu of service, and the industry standard post-retirement travel benefits for the CEO and Relevant Key Management Personnel.

During  FY2024/25,  there  was  only  one  employee  who  was  an  immediate  family  member  of  a  Director  and  whose remuneration exceeded $100,000, as follows:

| Between $100,000 and $200,000   | Between $100,000 and $200,000   | Between $100,000 and $200,000    |

There were no employees who were substantial shareholders of the Company, or were immediate family members of any other Director, the CEO or a substantial shareholder of the Company and whose remuneration exceeded $100,000, during FY2024/25.

## ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS (PRINCIPLE 9)

The Board, through its announcements of first-quarter and third-quarter business updates, as well as half-year and full-year results, aims to provide shareholders with a balanced and understandable assessment of the Company's performance and prospects. Management provides the Board with monthly management accounts for the Board's review.

The Company has clear policies and guidelines for dealings in securities by Directors and employees. The Company imposes a trading embargo on its Directors and employees from trading in its securities for the period of two weeks before the announcement of first-quarter and third-quarter financial results/business updates; and a period of one month before the announcement of half-year and full-year financial results. In addition, Directors and employees are cautioned to observe the insider trading laws at all times; and to avoid dealing in the Company's securities for short-term considerations.

## Risk Management and Internal Controls

The Board has overall responsibility for the governance of risk. To assist the Board in discharging its responsibility, the BSRC oversees the risk governance framework and risk management system, including reviewing key risks and controls put in place by Management. The AC also provides oversight of the financial reporting risk and the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's internal control systems.

To support the BSRC, a dedicated Risk Management Department looks into and oversees the Group's risk management framework. In addition, the Legal, Compliance and Secretariat Department manages certain key regulatory compliance policies. The Statement on Risk Management can be found on pages 72 to 74.

Annually, a report is submitted by the Risk Management Department to the Board, which provides a comprehensive review of the risks faced by the Group. The review includes the identification of risks overseen by the main Board and its various Board committees, as well as the current assessment and outlook of the various risk factors. The Department also performs risk prioritisation and ensures risk mitigation plans are reviewed by Management.

The Board had received assurance from the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer that the financial records have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's operations and finances.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (Continued)

The Board had also received assurance from the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer (who, in turn, had received assurance from Senior Management of the respective Group companies) that the Group's risk management and internal control systems were adequate and effective to address key risk areas, including financial, compliance, operational and information technology risks, which the Group considers relevant and material to its operations.

Having reviewed the risk management and internal control systems of the Group, work performed by the internal and external auditors, and reviews performed by Management and various Board committees, the Board, with the concurrence of the BSRC and AC, is of the opinion that the Group's risk management and internal control systems were adequate and effective as at 31 March 2025.

The Board notes that the risk management and internal control systems provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the Group will not be materially affected by any event that could be reasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its business objectives. In this regard, the Board also notes that no system can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgement in decision-making, human error, fraud or other irregularities.

## AUDIT COMMITTEE (PRINCIPLE 10)

The AC's activities for FY2024/25, in accordance with its responsibilities and duties under its Charter, included the matters set out below. To discharge its responsibilities and duties, the AC has full access to, and the co-operation of, Management. The AC also has full discretion to invite any Director or executive officer to attend its meetings, and has been given adequate resources to discharge its functions. The AC meets with the internal and external auditors without the presence of Management several times during the financial year under review.

## (A) Financial Reporting

The AC reviewed the quarterly business updates, as well as the half-year and annual financial statements, and financial announcements required by SGX-ST for recommendation to the Board for approval. The review focused on changes in accounting policies and practices, major judgmental and risk areas, significant adjustments resulting from the audit, the going concern assumption, compliance with accounting standards, compliance with SGX-ST and other legal requirements. The AC keeps itself apprised of changes in accounting policies and guidelines through scheduled regular updates by the external auditors, of such, in meeting agendas.

## (B) Financial Matters

In the review of the financial statements for FY2024/25, the following significant matters impacting the financial statements were reviewed by the AC and discussed with Management and the external auditors:

The AC also reviewed the fees and expenses paid to the external auditors, including fees paid for non-audit services during the financial year. The AC is of the opinion that the auditors' independence has not been compromised.

The  AC  considered  the  information  provided  by  the  external  auditors  under  the  Audit  Quality  Indicators  Disclosure Framework issued by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority in evaluating the performance and effectiveness of the external auditors.

The AC has also received communication from the external auditors that they have nothing to report with reference to the other financial or non-financial information in the Annual Report as defined in the Singapore Standard of Auditing 720.

The Company has complied with Rules 712 and 715 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual in relation to the appointment of its auditors.

## (D) Risk Management and Internal Control

The AC reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems, which includes financial, compliance, operational and information technology controls, to safeguard the interests of the Group and its shareholders.

The risk management and internal control systems are also audited periodically by the Internal Audit Division and their adequacy and effectiveness reported to the AC accordingly.

## (E) Interested Person Transactions

The Internal Audit Division reviewed the interested person transactions entered into by the Group to verify the accuracy and completeness of the interested person transactions disclosure and compliance with the SGX-ST reporting requirements under Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual. The AC, assisted by Internal Audit, reviewed interested person transactions to ensure compliance with the SGX-ST Listing Manual and the Shareholders' Mandate obtained at the last Annual General Meeting.

The  AC  is  satisfied  that  the  interested  person  transactions  were  made  on  normal  commercial  terms  and  were  not prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its minority shareholders. The Shareholders' Mandate, which is published in the Appendix to the Letter to Shareholders, defines the levels and procedures to obtain approval for such transactions.

## (F) Whistle-blowing

The AC reviewed and is satisfied with the adequacy of the whistle-blowing programme instituted by the Group which encourages staff and others to raise concerns, in confidence, about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters. The policy is communicated clearly to all employees on the Company's intranet, Staff Regulations and via a web-based training course. The Group is committed to ensure the protection of whistle-blowers against detrimental or unfair treatment. All information received is treated confidentially to protect the identity of whistle-blowers. Employees who reported in good faith will be protected from reprisal. The AC is responsible for the oversight of the whistle-blowing framework and processes. All whistle-blower reports were investigated independently by Internal Audit and the results reviewed by the AC at its quarterly meetings to ensure timely independent investigation and adequate resolution. The Company also publicly discloses the existence of whistle-blowing reporting channels on its corporate website.

## (G) Internal Audit

The Internal Audit Division is an independent division that reports directly to the AC. The division adopts a systemic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes by conducting risk-based audits and information technology audits across the Group. An annual audit plan is developed using a structured risk and control assessment framework through which the inherent risk and control environment of each auditable unit in the Group is assessed. The risk-based annual audit plan is aligned to the key strategies and risks across the Group's business. SIA's Internal Audit Division uses analytical tools to perform data analysis in selected audit areas that are more susceptible to fraud risk. This has enabled Internal Audit to be more effective in providing audit assurance to Management and the Board.

The Head of Internal Audit meets quarterly with the AC without the presence of Management during the financial year under review. The appointment and termination of the Head of Internal Audit is reviewed and decided by the AC. The AC reviewed and approved the scope of internal audit work and its annual audit programme. Annually, the AC evaluates and is of the opinion that the Internal Audit function is independent, effective, and adequately resourced. Internal Audit has unfettered access to all the Group's documents, records, properties and personnel, including access to the AC. It is free from any undue influence that would impair its ability to discharge its responsibilities objectively and has appropriate standing within the Group. All significant audit findings, recommendations made, and Management's responses thereto are reported to AC and Management. Significant issues are discussed at AC meetings. Internal Audit follows up on all recommendations to ensure that Management has implemented the recommendations in a timely manner and reports the results to the AC every quarter.

SIA's Internal Audit is a member of the Singapore Chapter of the Institute of Internal Auditors ('IIA') and meets the Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set by the IIA, including its Code of Ethics. SIA's Internal Audit Division is adequately staffed by persons with relevant qualifications and experience. The professional competence of SIA's Internal Audit is maintained or upgraded through professional certifications, training programmes, conferences and seminars that provide updates on auditing techniques and regulations.

Quality assessment reviews are carried out at least once in five years by external qualified professionals. An external quality assessment review was completed in FY2024/25. The results affirmed that the Internal Audit function generally conforms with the IIA standards, International Professional Practices Framework ('IPPF') and the IIA Code of Ethics.

## (H) Internal Review of Sustainability Reporting Processes

The AC reviewed the scope of the internal review of sustainability reporting processes in accordance with Rule 711B of the SGX-ST Listing Manual. In FY2024/25, the internal review was carried out by SIA's Internal Audit Division.

The AC reviewed all significant audit findings reported, recommendations made, and Management's responses thereto. Internal Audit will follow up on all recommendations to ensure Management has implemented the recommendations in a timely manner, and will report the results to the AC.

## (I) Control Self-Assessment

The Control Self-Assessment ('CSA') Programme, established since FY2003/04, provides a framework for Management to obtain ground-up assurance from business units on the state of internal controls. It entails the business units reviewing and reporting annually to Management on the adequacy of internal controls at their units. The Internal Audit Division performed independent reviews during the financial year to validate the results of these self-assessments. The outcome of the CSA results was reported to the AC.

## SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND ENGAGEMENT SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND CONDUCT OF GENERAL MEETINGS (PRINCIPLE 11) ENGAGEMENT WITH SHAREHOLDERS (PRINCIPLE 12)

Singapore Airlines is committed to continually strengthen its relationship with the investing community and believes in timely and consistent disclosure of pertinent, price-sensitive and/or trade-sensitive information to enable a transparent assessment of the Company's value. The Company holds analyst and media briefings when announcing half-year and full-year results.

Overseas-based analysts and media are also able to join these briefings virtually. The audio webcasts are subsequently uploaded on the Company's website under the Investor Relations section. The Company publishes the transcripts of the Question and Answer segment on SGXNet and the Financial Results webpage.

All financial results, as well as price-sensitive and trade-sensitive information, are released in a timely manner through various media, including disclosures via SGXNet and press releases posted on the Company's website. The Company's website is an important source of information for shareholders and the investing community. Quarterly business updates, half-year and full-year results announcements, news releases, presentation slides, monthly operating statistics, annual reports, sustainability reports and other key facts and figures about the Company are available in the Investor Relations webpages.

The  Company  values  dialogue  with  the  investing  community,  and  the  Investor  Relations  Department  frequently engages with analysts and investors through conference calls and emails. The team also actively participates in investor conferences to keep the investing community abreast of relevant developments. A dedicated investor relations email address (investor\_relations@singaporeair.com.sg) is maintained for shareholders or investors to reach out to the Company for queries.

## Conduct of General Meetings

All Board members attend the shareholders' meetings of the Company, whether in person or virtually. To foster deeper engagement with shareholders, the CEO presents an overview of the key strategies of the Company and other related matters at the start of shareholders' meetings, regardless whether such meetings are held physically or virtually. This enables shareholders to develop more informed views on matters affecting the Company. Shareholders are given the opportunity to raise questions prior to, and at, the meetings. Shareholders are also informed of the voting procedures in advance. The minutes of the last shareholders' meeting are made available on the Company's website within one month of the date of such meeting.

The Company resumed the holding of physical general meetings in 2023, as was its practice prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. During the annual general meeting in 2024, Board members together with Key Management Personnel were present in person. To enhance transparency in the voting process, the Company has, since FY2008/09, implemented full poll voting for all the resolutions tabled at its shareholders' meetings. Singapore Airlines appoints an independent external party as scrutineer for the electronic poll voting process. Prior to the shareholders' meeting, the scrutineer reviews the proxies and electronic poll voting system, and attends the proxy verification process. This ensures that the proxy and poll voting information are compiled correctly.

The poll voting results, including the number and percentage of votes cast for and against each of the resolutions tabled at the shareholders' meeting, are presented to the shareholders. The poll voting results are filed with SGX on the same day as the meeting.

## MANAGING STAKEHOLDERS RELATIONSHIPS ENGAGEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS (PRINCIPLE 13)

The Company has arrangements in place to identify and engage with its material stakeholder groups and to manage its  relationship  with  such  groups.  These  arrangements  as  well  as  strategies  and  key  areas  of  focus  in  relation  to  the management of stakeholder relationships are set out in the Company's Sustainability Report. In particular for the key supplier stakeholder group, SIA meets the SATS Group periodically to develop stronger business relationships.

The Company maintains a corporate website to communicate and engage with external stakeholders such as customers, shareholders and investors, and an intranet for employee stakeholder engagement. Various other channels such as mobile applications are also employed to communicate and engage with relevant stakeholder groups.

## Other Matters

Lenders to SIA are to note that all bank transactions undertaken by any Group Company must be properly authorised, including the opening of new bank accounts and any proposed credit facilities. Each Group Company has its own approval limits and procedures for every banking transaction, having regard to the nature of the transaction concerned. These approval limits and procedures are updated from time to time and are available on request. The bankers of each Group Company should always verify, in accordance with the verification process set out in the applicable procedures, that the transaction is properly authorised.

The Company has in place (or previously had in place) the SIA Restricted Share Plan 2014 ('RSP 2014'), the SIA Restricted Share Plan 2024 ('RSP 2024'), the SIA Performance Share Plan 2014 ('PSP 2014') and the SIA Performance Share Plan 2024 ('PSP 2024').

At the date of this statement, the Board Compensation &amp; Industrial Relations Committee ('BCIRC') which administers the RSP 2014, RSP 2024, PSP 2014 and PSP 2024 comprises the following Directors:

Peter Seah Lim Huat Simon Cheong Sae Peng Jeanette Wong Kai Yuan

Chairman (Independent)

## RSP 2014/RSP 2024 and PSP 2014/PSP 2024

Details of the RSP 2014/RSP 2024 and PSP 2014/PSP 2024 are disclosed in note 5 to the financial statements.

The RSP 2014 and PSP 2014 were approved by the shareholders of the Company on 30 July 2014. The duration of the RSP 2014 and PSP 2014 was 10 years each, commencing from 30 July 2014. The RSP 2014 and PSP 2014 expired on 29 July 2024. The expiry of the RSP 2014 and PSP 2014 was without prejudice to the rights of holders of awards outstanding under the RSP 2014 and PSP 2014 as at the date of such expiry.

At the Annual General Meeting held on 29 July 2024, shareholders approved the adoption of the RSP 2024 and PSP 2024 to replace the RSP 2014 and PSP 2014. The duration of the RSP 2024 and PSP 2024 is 10 years each, commencing from 29 July 2024.

Under the RSP 2014/RSP 2024, a base number of conditional share awards ('Base Award') was/is granted to eligible participants  annually.  Depending  on  the  achievement  of  pre-determined  targets  over  a  one-year  performance period for awards granted from 2016 onwards, the BCIRC will determine an achievement factor which will then be applied to the Base Award to determine the final number of RSP 2014/ RSP 2024 shares to be awarded at the end of the respective performance periods ('Final Award'). All RSP awards reported for the financial period under review were granted from 2016 onwards.

## DIRECTORS' STATEMENT

## 4 Equity Compensation Plans of the Company (continued)

Under the PSP 2014/PSP 2024, a base number of conditional share awards ('Base Award') was/is granted to eligible participants annually. Depending on the achievement of pre-determined targets over a three-year performance period, the BCIRC will determine an achievement factor which will then be applied to the Base Award to determine the final number of PSP 2014/PSP 2024 shares to be awarded at the end of the respective performance periods ('Final Award').

The achievement factor could range from 0% to 200% for both the RSP 2014/RSP 2024 and PSP 2014/PSP 2024.

One-third of the RSP 2014/RSP 2024 Final Awards of fully paid ordinary shares will be released to the participants at the end of the one-year performance period. The balance will be released equally over the subsequent two years with fulfilment of service requirements.

For the strategic awards of restricted shares granted under the RSP 2014/RSP 2024, half of the Final Awards of fully paid ordinary shares was released to the participants on the date of grant. The balance will be released equally over the subsequent two years with fulfilment of service requirements. On the final vesting date, an additional equity kicker equivalent to 20% of the Final Award will be settled with the participant.

All the PSP 2014/PSP 2024 Final Awards of fully paid ordinary shares will be released to the participants at the end of the three-year performance period. RSP 2014 and PSP 2014 Final Awards released during the financial year under review were satisfied by way of the transfer of 4,217,174 treasury shares and the allotment and issue of 80,279 new shares to the participants.

No participant has received 5% or more of the total number of awards granted under the RSP 2014 and PSP 2014, or 5% or more of the total number of shares available under the RSP 2024 and PSP 2024.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

## To The Members Of Singapore Airlines Limited

## REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Singapore Airlines Limited ('the Company') and its subsidiaries ('the Group'), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company as at 31 March 2025, the consolidated profit and loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group, and the statement of changes in equity of the Company for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information, as set out on pages 117 to 213.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 ('the Act'), Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) ('SFRS(I)s') and IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IFRS Accounting Standards') so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 March 2025 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group, and the changes in equity of the Company for the year ended on that date.

## Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing ('SSAs'). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities ('ACRA Code') together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities  in  accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

## To The Members Of Singapore Airlines Limited

## Accuracy of passenger revenue

Refer to note 2(o) 'Revenue' for the relevant accounting policy.

## The key audit matter

## How the matter was addressed in our audit

Passenger  sales  are  not  recognised  as  revenue immediately but are deferred to be recorded later as revenue in the profit and loss account when the related  transportation  service  is  provided.  Such deferred revenue is presented on the statement of financial position as sales in advance of carriage and is measured based on the sales price to the customer, net of discounts and rebates.

Passenger revenue accounts for the largest share of the Group's business operation and comprises high volume of individually low value transactions. The amount of revenue to be recognised for each flight  as  it  is  flown  relies  on  complex  internal  IT systems that handle large volumes of transaction data  and  includes  the  exchange  of  information with industry systems and partner airlines.

As a result of the complexity, this is a key focus area in our audit.

We evaluated the design and implementation, and the operating effectiveness of relevant general IT system controls that supports the reliable operation  of the IT system  application  controls identified above, including user access controls and controls over programming and configuration.

We evaluated the design and implementation, and the operating effectiveness  of  related  IT  system  application  controls  relating to  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  transfers  of  data  between systems and validation checks to identify data errors.

We  evaluated  the  design  and  implementation,  and  operating effectiveness of relevant manual controls to assess the accuracy of  the  revenue  recognised,  including  the  appropriateness  of  the treatment  applied  to  exceptions  and  reconciliations  of  the  SIA Group's records with the outputs from shared industry systems and partner airlines.

We  checked  samples  of passenger revenue transactions to underlying  records  including  evidence  of  payment  and  flight records to assess the accuracy of the revenue recognised.

## Findings

Our testing performed on relevant IT and manual controls over the passenger revenue systems, and the checking of selected revenue transactions to their underlying records, found the accuracy of Passenger Revenue to be appropriate.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

## To The Members Of Singapore Airlines Limited

## Acquisition of Air India

Refer to note 2(d) 'Associated companies' for the relevant accounting policy.

## The key audit matter

## How the matter was addressed in our audit

On  12 November  2024,  SIA announced  the completion of the merger of its associated company, TATA-SIA Airlines Limited ('TATASIA')  and  Air  India  Limited  ('AI'),  collectively  the enlarged  AI  Group.  SIA  holds  a  25.1%  stake  in the  enlarged  AI  Group  after  the  completion  of the  merger.  At  acquisition  date,  Management recognised a cost of investment in AI of $1,928.6 million  and  recognised  a  non-cash  accounting gain of $1,097.9 million for the SIA Group.

This transaction requires the purchase price to be allocated ('PPA') to the fair values of the identifiable assets,  including  intangible  assets  acquired  and liabilities assumed. The PPA is a key audit matter given  the  judgement  and  estimation  uncertainty involved  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  the assets and liabilities assumed in the acquisition.

We reviewed the underlying agreements and assessed the terms and conditions affecting the purchase consideration and acquisition accounting.

For  the  31  March  2025  consolidated  financial  statements,  the PPA  amounts  have  been  determined  on  a  provisional  basis.  We have assessed the competency and objectivity of the valuers that management have engaged for the PPA.

We involved our valuation specialists in assessing the reasonableness of the method and key assumptions used by the valuer in determining the fair values where applicable.

We have involved a component auditor in auditing material financial balances  as  disclosed  in  note  25  to  the  consolidated  financial statements and assessed the adequacy of audit evidence obtained from the work performed by our component auditor.

We  have  evaluated  the  completeness,  accuracy,  and  relevance of  the  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in accordance with IFRS 3.

## Findings

Based on our procedures performed above, we found that the initial accounting for the acquisition of Air India based on provisional values and the related disclosures are in compliance with IFRS 3.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

## To The Members Of Singapore Airlines Limited

## Other Information

Management is responsible for the other information contained in the annual report. Other information is defined as all information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon.

We have obtained the Interested Person Transactions and Group Corporate Structure ('the Reports'), prior to the date of this auditors' report. The remaining other information contained in the annual report is expected to be made available to us after that date.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

When we read the Reports, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to the Audit Committee and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs.

## Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements

Management  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  that  give  a  true  and  fair  view  in  accordance with the provisions of the Act, SFRS(I)s and IFRS Accounting Standards, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

## To The Members Of Singapore Airlines Limited

## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- · Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.
- · Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls.
- · Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- · Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- · Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the  financial  statements,  including  the  disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- · Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the group as a basis for forming an opinion on the group financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless the law or regulations preclude public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

## REPORT ON LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## For the Financial Year ended 31 March 2025

## 2 Material Accounting Policies (continued)

## (d) Associated companies

In the Company's separate financial statements, investments in associated companies are accounted for at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

An associated company is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies of the entity. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds 20% or more of the voting power of another entity.

The Group accounts for its investments in associated companies using the equity method, initially at cost. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued or liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of associated companies, until the date on which significant influence ceases. Dividends reduce the carrying amounts of the investments.

Goodwill  on  associated  companies  represents  the  excess  of  the  cost  of  acquisition  of  the  associated companies over the Group's share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the associated companies. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an associated company is not recognised separately, and therefore, is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in the associated company is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in associated company may be impacted.

When the Group's share of losses in an associated company equals or exceeds its interest in the associated company, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associated company.

The most recently available unaudited management financial statements of the associated companies are used by the Group in applying the equity method. Where the dates of the financial statements used are not coterminous with those of the Group, the share of results is arrived at from the last audited financial statements available and unaudited management financial statements to the end of the accounting period where provided by the associated company. Otherwise, an estimate is made for the balances to the end of the accounting period based on historical experience and adjusted for the effects of known significant transactions. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

Upon the loss of significant influence over the associated company, the Group measures the retained interest at fair value. Any difference between the fair value of the aggregate of the retained interest and proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the investment at the date the equity method was discontinued is recognised in profit or loss.

## (e) Intangible assets

## Amortisation

Amortisation of computer software is recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 10 years.

For deferred engine development cost which is made in connection with its participation in aircraft engine development projects with other companies, amortisation begins when the aircraft engines are available for sale. These deferred engine development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of expected sales of the aircraft engines, which is estimated to be over a period of 39 years.

Advance and progress payments are not amortised. Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of the reporting period and adjusted if appropriate.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## For the Financial Year ended 31 March 2025

## 2 Material Accounting Policies (continued)

## (f) Foreign currencies

## Foreign currency transactions

Foreign currency transactions are translated into SGD at the rates prevailing at the dates of those transactions.

All foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into SGD at rates prevailing at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.

The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary assets and liabilities is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the year, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the year, and the amortised cost in foreign currency re-translated at the exchange rate at the end of the year.

Foreign currency differences are recognised in the profit and loss account, except for qualifying cash flow hedges which are deferred to equity.

## Foreign operations

For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the net assets of foreign subsidiary, associated and joint venture companies are translated into SGD at rates prevailing at the reporting date. The financial results of foreign subsidiary, associated and joint venture companies are translated monthly into SGD at prevailing exchange rates. The resulting gains or losses on exchange are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve.

## (g) Property, plant and equipment

## (i) Recognition and measurement

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. When parts of a property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate components. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset, including capitalised borrowing cost.

Leasehold hotel properties held by an associated company are carried at fair value, less accumulated depreciation  and  accumulated  impairment  losses.  Fair  values  of  leasehold  hotel  properties  are determined  by  independent  professional  valuers  on  an  annual  basis.  The  Group's  share  of  the revaluation gain or loss is reflected under the share of post-acquisition capital reserve.

## (ii) Depreciation of property, plant and equipment

Depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Operational lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed annually, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Significant components of individual assets are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, that component is depreciated separately. Depreciation is recognised from the date the property, plant and equipment is installed and ready for use.

Freehold land, advance and progress payments are not depreciated.

The residual values of certain aircraft are subject to foreign currency fluctuations and are remeasured to the prevailing exchange rates at the end of the reporting period.

## (h) Leases

At the inception of the contract, the Group assesses if the contract contains a lease.

## (i) As a lessee

The Group recognises a right-of-use ('ROU') asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date.

## ROU asset

ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, and an estimated cost to restore the underlying asset, less any lease incentive received.

The ROU asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, except for embedded engine overhaul cost. The embedded engine overhaul cost is depreciated over the useful life on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment disclosed in note 2(g). In addition, the ROU asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liabilities.

Major  improvements  and  modifications  to  leased  aircraft  due  to  operational  requirements  are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives (estimated to be 4 to 12 years).

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## For the Financial Year ended 31 March 2025

## 2 Material Accounting Policies (continued)

## (h) Leases (continued)

## (i) As a lessee (continued)

## Short-term leases and leases of low value assets

The Group has elected not to recognise ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases of low value and short-term aircraft  and  engine  leases.  The  Group  recognises  the  lease  payments  associated  with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

## (i) Inventories

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of inventories is determined on a weighted average basis and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition.

## (j) Financial instruments

## (i) Recognition and initial measurement

A  financial  asset  or  financial  liability  (unless  it  is  a  trade  receivable  without  a  significant  financing component) is initially measured at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset or liability not carried at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.

## (ii) Classification and subsequent measurement

## Financial assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI') or FVTPL.

For  equity  investments  that  are  not  held  for  trading,  the  Group  may  irrevocably  elect,  on  initial recognition,  to  present  subsequent  changes  in  fair  value  in  other  comprehensive  income.  This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset, that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI, to be measured at FVTPL, if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

## Business model assessment

The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to Management.

## Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers contingent events, leverage features, modifications of the time value of money and other limiting terms in the contractual terms of the instrument, which could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that the cash flows of the instrument would not be reflective of solely payments of principal and interest.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## For the Financial Year ended 31 March 2025

## 2 Material Accounting Policies (continued)

## (j) Financial instruments (continued)

## (iii) Derecognition

## Financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial  asset  expire,  or  when  it  transfers  the  rights  to  receive  the  contractual  cash  flows  in  a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

## Financial liabilities

The  Group  derecognises  a  financial  liability  when  its  contractual  obligations  are  discharged  or cancelled, or expire.

## (iv) Offsetting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statements of financial position, when and only when, there is a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

## (v) Impairment

## Expected credit loss ('ECL')

The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for the following which are measured as 12-month ECL:

- · Non-equity financial instruments that are determined to have a low credit risk at the reporting date; and
- · Other non-equity financial instruments (other than trade debtors) on which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial recognition.

Loss allowances for trade debtors are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.

The Group considers a non-equity financial instrument to have a low credit risk when its credit quality is rated to be of an investment grade by credit rating agencies.

## (vi) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting

The  Group  uses  derivative  financial  instruments  such  as  forward  currency  contracts,  foreign currency option contracts, fixed deposit contracts, cross currency swap contracts, interest rate swap contracts, jet fuel option contracts, jet fuel and Brent and crack swap contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency, interest rate and jet fuel price fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into; any attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are remeasured at their fair values. The Group also utilises financial liabilities to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency risks embedded within the residual values of owned aircraft.

Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the profit and loss account.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## For the Financial Year ended 31 March 2025

## 2 Material Accounting Policies (continued)

## (j) Financial instruments (continued)

## (vi) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting (continued)

## Designation of hedges

The Group designates certain derivatives as well as non-derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships. On initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, including the risk management objective and strategy in undertaking the hedge, the economic relationship between the hedge instrument and the hedged item, the effects of credit risk on the hedge, the hedge ratio and the hedge type (cash flow or fair value).

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group makes an assessment of whether the hedging instrument is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged item during the period for which the hedge is designated. For a cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction, the Group also assesses whether the forecast transaction is highly probable to occur and if it presents an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit or loss.

If  the  hedging  instrument  no  longer  meets  the  criteria  for  hedge  accounting,  expires  or  is  sold, terminated or exercised, hedge accounting is discontinued. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the fair value reserve remains there until the forecast transaction occurs. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.

## (k) Loans, notes payable and borrowings

Loans, notes payable and other borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans, notes and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

## (l) Provisions

Provisions for return costs to meet contractual minimum conditions for the return of aircraft, at the end of the lease terms for aircraft under operating leases, are recorded over the lease terms.

## (m) Mandatory convertible bonds ('MCBs')

The test on the classification of MCBs as equity or as liability is based on the substance of the contractual arrangement. If there is no obligation on the Group to pay cash to the holders or to settle the MCBs with a variable number of the Company's ordinary shares, they are classified as equity. In all other cases, the instrument is accounted for as a liability. Upon issuance, the MCBs are measured at the transaction price including  qualifying  issuance  costs.  MCBs  accounted  for  as  equity  instruments  are  subsequently  not remeasured. Liabilities are subsequently accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest rate. Upon settlement  of  equity  classified  MCBs  by  issuance  of  ordinary  shares  upon  conversion  or  by  early redemption at the option of the Company, all amounts are also directly recognised in equity.

The MCBs issued by the Company are convertible at maturity only into a fixed number of ordinary shares of the Company. The holders have no right to demand repayment of the MCBs from the Company. The Company  has  the  right  to  redeem  the  MCBs  at  its  sole  discretion  for  cash  amounts  stipulated  in  the contractual terms for each redemption date that includes an imputed return on investment. The MCBs are denominated in SGD.

The net proceeds of the MCBs issued (including any directly attributable transaction costs) are classified entirely as an equity component.

When the MCBs are redeemed before its maturity date, the difference between any redemption consideration and the carrying amount of the MCBs are directly recognised in equity at the date of transaction.

## 2 Material Accounting Policies (continued)

## (n) Taxation

## (i) Current income tax

Tax  recoverable  and  tax  liabilities  for  current  and  prior  periods  are  measured  at  the  amount expected to be recovered from or paid to, respectively, the tax authorities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at balance sheet date. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.

Current  income  taxes  are  recognised  in  the  profit  or  loss  account  except  to  the  extent  that  the tax  relates  to  a  business  combination,  or  items  recognised  outside  profit  or  loss,  either  in  other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

## (ii) Deferred tax

Deferred tax is provided, using the balance sheet method, on all temporary differences at the end of the reporting period between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised for:

- · Temporary differences on the initial  recognition  of  goodwill  or  of  an  asset  or  liability  in  a transaction  that  is  not  a  business  combination  and,  at  the  time  of  the  transaction,  affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
- · Temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiary, associated and joint venture companies, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Temporary differences in relation to a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for a specific lease are regarded as a net package (the lease) for the purpose of recognising deferred tax.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of each reporting period.

Deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same tax authority.

## (iii) Global minimum top-up tax

The Group has determined that the global minimum top-up tax - which it is required to pay under Pillar Two legislation - is an income tax in the scope of IAS 12. The Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## For the Financial Year ended 31 March 2025

## 2 Material Accounting Policies (continued)

## (o) Revenue

Revenue is principally earned from the carriage of passengers, cargo and mail, engineering services, tour activities and sale of merchandise, amongst others. Revenue for the Group excludes dividends from subsidiary companies and intra-group transactions.

## (i) Passenger, cargo and mail

Passenger,  cargo  and  mail  sales  are  recognised  as  operating  revenue  when  the  transportation  is provided. The value of unutilised tickets and airway bills is included in current liabilities as sales in advance of carriage. Breakage revenue (tickets sold and not uplifted at flight date) is recognised at flight date by estimating a percentage of tickets that will never be utilised, based on historical trends and experience. Where historical trends and experience are not appropriate, the value of unutilised tickets one year after expiry is recognised as revenue. The value of airway bills is recognised as revenue if unused after one year.

The Group sells certain tickets with connecting flights with one or more segments operated by its other airline partners. For segments operated by its other airline partners, the Group has determined that it is acting as an agent on behalf of other airlines as they are responsible for their portion of the contract (i.e., transportation of the passenger). The Group, as the agent, recognises revenue at the time of the travel for the net amount representing commission to be retained by the Group for any segments flown by other airlines.

The Group has applied the practical expedient and recognised the costs of selling airline travel tickets as an expense when it is incurred.

## (ii) Engineering services

Revenue from repair and maintenance of aircraft, and engine and component overhaul is recognised based on the percentage of completion of the projects. The percentage of completion of the projects is determined based on the number of man-hours incurred to date against the estimated man-hours needed to complete the projects.

## (iii) KrisFlyer

The Company operates a frequent flyer programme called 'KrisFlyer' that provides travel awards to programme members based on accumulated mileage. A portion of passenger revenue attributable to the award of frequent flyer benefits is deferred until they are utilised.

In  addition,  the  Company  sells  miles  to  programme  partners  for  issuance  to  their  programme members. For miles purchased by programme partners, revenue is deferred until awards are utilised.

The deferment of the revenue is estimated based on historical trends of breakage, which is then used to project the expected utilisation of these benefits.

## (iv) Others

Revenue from tour activities is recognised upon commencement of the tours.

The Group operates a payments and lifestyle rewards app called 'Kris+' that provides rewards to programme members based on in-app spending. In addition, the Group sells miles to programme partners and merchants for issuance to their programme members and revenue is deferred until awards are utilised. The deferment of the revenue is estimated based on historical trends of breakage, which is then used to project the expected utilisation of these benefits.

Revenue from sale of merchandise is recognised when the product is delivered and received by the customer.

Rental income from the lease of aircraft is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

## 2 Material Accounting Policies (continued)

## (p) Aircraft maintenance and overhaul costs

The Group recognises aircraft maintenance and overhaul expenses (except heavy maintenance visits, engine overhaul  and  landing  gear  overhaul  expenses)  on  an  incurred  basis.  For  engine  overhaul  costs  covered by power-by-hour third-party maintenance agreements, a portion of the cost is expensed at a fixed rate per hour during the terms of the agreements. The remaining payments made are recorded as an advance payment, to the extent that it is to be utilised in the future. Upon completion of an overhaul, these amounts are transferred to property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful lives.

## (q) Borrowing costs

Borrowing  costs  incurred  to  finance  advance  and  progress  payments  for  aircraft  are  capitalised  as  part of  advance  and  progress  payments  until  the  aircraft  are  commissioned  for  operation  or  the  projects are completed. All other borrowing costs are recognised as finance charges in the period in which they are incurred.

## (r) Segment reporting

## (i) Business segment

For management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on the nature of  the  services  provided which are independently managed by the respective segment managers responsible  for  the  performance  of  the  respective  segments  under  their  charge.  The  segment managers report directly to corporate management who regularly review the segment results in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess the segment performance.

## (ii) Geographical segment

The analysis of revenue by area of original sale from airline operations is derived by allocating revenue to the area in which the sale was made. Revenue from other operations, which consist principally of engineering services, is derived in East Asia and is therefore, not shown.

Assets,  which  consist  principally  of  flight  and  ground  equipment,  support  the  entire  worldwide transportation  system,  and  are  mainly  located  in  Singapore.  An  analysis  of  assets  and  capital expenditure of the Group by geographical distribution has therefore not been included.

## 3 Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Judgements

Estimates and assumptions concerning the future are made in the preparation of the financial statements. They affect the application of the Group's accounting policies, reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and disclosures made. Actual results may differ from these estimates. They are assessed on an ongoing basis and are based on experience and relevant factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.

## (a) Provision for lease return costs

Prior to the return of aircraft leased by the Group entities to the lessor, the Group entities are required to fulfil certain lease return conditions which may include the completion of certain maintenance activities to the airframe and engines and the reconfiguration of seats within the aircraft. The provision for lease return costs for these leased aircraft is determined based on the best estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfil the stipulated lease return conditions. The carrying amount of the provision for the Group and the Company at 31 March 2025 was $1,033.3 million (2024: $1,186.2 million) and $379.8 million (2024: $491.0 million) respectively.

## (b) Accounting for the acquisition of Air India Limited ('AI')

During the financial year, the Group completed the acquisition of AI. The acquisition requires the evaluation of the fair values of the identifiable assets, including intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed. The evaluation of the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities assumed involves significant estimates over the cashflow projections, discount rate, useful lives of assets and allocation of the resultant goodwill. Refer to note 25 for details of the AI acquisition.

## 4 Segment Information (in $ million)

Management has determined that the Group has the following reportable segments:

- (i) The Full-Service Carrier ('FSC') segment provides passenger and cargo air transportation under the Singapore Airlines brand with a focus on full-service passenger segment.
- (ii) The Low-Cost Carrier ('LCC') segment provides passenger air transportation under the Scoot brand with a focus on the low-cost passenger segment.
- (iii) Engineering  services  segment  provides  airframe  maintenance  and  overhaul  services,  line  maintenance, technical ground handling services and fleet management. It also manufactures aircraft cabin equipment, refurbishes aircraft galleys, provides technical and non-technical handling services and repair and overhaul of hydro-mechanical aircraft equipment.

Other  services  provided  by  the  Group,  such  as  tour  activities,  payments  and  lifestyle  reward  app,  and  sale  of merchandise,  have  been  aggregated  under  the  segment  'Others'.  None  of  these  segments  meets  any  of  the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments in FY2024/25 or FY2023/24.

Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss which in certain respects, as explained in the table below, is measured differently from operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements.

Transactions carried out between operating segments during the financial year are in the normal course of business.

## Share-based compensation arrangements

As at 31 March 2025, the Group has the following share-based compensation arrangements:

## (a) Share-based incentive plans (equity-settled)

The SIA Restricted Share Plan 2014 ('RSP 2014') and the SIA Performance Share Plan 2014 ('PSP 2014') are share-based incentive plans for senior executives and key Senior Management, which were approved by the shareholders of the Company at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 30 July 2014.

The RSP 2014 awards fully paid ordinary shares of the Company, conditional on position and individual performance  targets  set  at  the  start  of  the  one-year  performance  period  based  on  annual  Group  and Company objectives.

In respect of FY2024/25 Strategic Share Award ('SSA') under the RSP 2014, the award made in July 2024 to Senior Management (Senior Vice Presidents and above) was based on Board Compensation &amp; Industrial Relations Committee ('BCIRC') assessment of SIA Management's Covid-19 recovery.

The  FY2024/25  RSP  2014  award  was  made  in  July  2024  on  a  contingent  performance  basis  to  Senior Management and other key executives (Vice Presidents and Divisional Vice Presidents).

The PSP 2014 awards fully paid ordinary shares of the Company, conditional on performance targets set at the start of a three-year overlapping performance period based on stretched long-term total shareholder return  objectives.  A  carbon  emissions  reduction  performance  condition  has  been  incorporated  into  the FY2024/25 PSP 2014 award.

The  FY2024/25  PSP  2014  award  was  made  in  July  2024  on  a  contingent  performance  basis  to Senior Management.

On 29 July 2024, the shareholders of the Company approved the RSP 2024 and PSP 2024 at the Annual General Meeting, to replace the RSP 2014 and PSP 2014 respectively which expired on 29 July 2024.

## 10 Taxation (in $ million)

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is involved in determining the provision for  income taxes. There are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for expected tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

## Major components of income tax expense

The major components of income tax expense for the years ended 31 March 2025 and 2024 are:

The Group has tax losses and deductible temporary differences (for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised) of approximately $212.9 million (2024: $185.3 million) and $32.3 million (2024: $29.5 million) respectively that are available for offset against future taxable profits of the companies. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is uncertain that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits therefrom. The use of tax losses is subject to agreement of the tax authorities and compliance with certain provisions of the tax legislation of the respective countries in which the companies operate. Out of these tax losses, $13.4 million (2024: $13.8 million) will expire between 2028 - 2035 (2024: 2028 - 2034). In Singapore, these tax losses do not expire under current tax legislation.

A reconciliation between taxation expense and the product of accounting profit multiplied by the applicable tax rate for the years ended 31 March is as follows:

Global minimum top-up tax

The Group is within the scope of Global Anti-Base Erosion ('GloBE') rules introduced by the OECD under the new global minimum top-up tax framework ('Pillar Two'). The Group has assessed that it is not subject to the top-up tax in the countries where the Group operates which have enacted or substantively enacted Pillar Two legislation for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2024. The Group therefore did not recognise any current tax expense relating to the top-up tax during the financial year ended 31 March 2025.

The Group also operates in countries that have enacted or substantively enacted Pillar Two legislation for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2025. The Group is still in the midst of assessing the impact for the financial year ending 31 March 2026.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial year, and assuming the conversion of all MCBs.

For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the profit attributable to owners of the Company is adjusted to take into account the potential dilution from interest on convertible bonds, net of tax, and share-based incentive plans of a subsidiary company. The weighted average number of ordinary shares of the Company in issue is also adjusted to take into account effects of dilutive convertible bonds and share-based incentive plans of the Company.

The average market value of the Company's shares for purposes of calculating the potential dilution from share-based incentive plans was based on quoted market prices for the year.

The holders of ordinary shares (except treasury shares) are entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by the Company. All ordinary shares, which have no par value, carry one vote per share without restriction. All shares rank equally with regards to the Group's residual assets.

The  Company's  ability  to  operate  its  existing  route  network  and  flight  frequency  is  derived  solely  from  and dependent entirely on the Air Service Agreements ('ASAs') concluded between the Government of Singapore and the governments of other countries. ASAs are therefore critical to the Company's operations. In almost all the ASAs, it is a condition that the Company must at all times be 'effectively controlled' and 'substantially owned' by Singapore nationals for the tenure of the respective ASAs.

In order to comply with the above requirement, one non-tradeable Special Share was issued to the Ministry of Finance ('the Special Member'). The Special Share enjoys all the rights attached to ordinary shares. In addition, pursuant to Article 3A of the Articles of Association, no resolution may be passed on certain matters without prior written approval of the Special Member.

The Company can also issue non-tradeable redeemable cumulative preference shares, which carry full voting rights ('ASA shares'). When issued, the ASA shares will be paid at $0.01 each and will carry equal voting rights as those of ordinary shares. These shares will be issued only when the Directors determine that the Company's operating rights under any of the ASAs are threatened by reason of the nationality of the majority shareholders.

No shares were issued (FY2023/24: 46,624) pursuant to conversion of convertible bonds during the year.

80,279 shares were issued (FY2023/24: nil) upon vesting of share-based incentive plans during the year.

Following the review of the Group's fleet plan and cessation of certain inventory management contracts, certain aircraft and aircraft spares were classified as held for sale as the Group had decided to sell the aircraft and aircraft spares. During the previous financial year, all the aircraft held for sale were disposed. The sale of the spares is expected to be completed within the next financial year.

Trade debtors are non-interest bearing. The carrying amount of trade debtors impaired by credit losses is reduced through the use of an allowance account unless the Group writes off the amount ascertained to be uncollectible. In  subsequent  periods  when  a  trade  debtor  is  ascertained  to  be  uncollectible,  it  is  written  off  against  the allowance account.

Significant  financial  difficulties  of  the  debtor,  probability  that  the  debtor  will  enter  bankruptcy  or  financial reorganisation,  and  default  or  delinquency  in  payments  (more  than  90  days  ageing  of  debtor  balances)  are considered indicators that the trade debtor is impaired. Individual trade debtor is written off when Management deems the amount not to be collectible.

Contract assets relate to the Group's rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. The contract assets are transferred to trade debtors when the rights become unconditional. This usually occurs when the Group invoices the customers.

Amounts owing by subsidiary, associated and joint venture companies are unsecured, trade-related, non-interest bearing and repayable on demand. The amounts are stated at net of accumulated impairment losses.

Included in trade and other creditors are amounts owing to related parties of $415.2 million (2024: $431.0 million) and $387.6 million (2024: $357.1 million) for the Group and Company respectively.

Funds from subsidiary companies are unsecured and have varying repayment terms. Interest on funds from subsidiary companies are computed using prevailing market rates which range from 2.15% to 3.79% (FY2023/24: 3.00% to 4.22%) per annum for SGD funds, and 4.30% to 4.44% (FY2023/24: 5.30% to 5.68%) per annum for USD funds.

As at 31 March 2025, 38.8% (2024: 41.0%) of the funds from subsidiary companies were denominated in USD.

Amounts owing to related parties, subsidiary, associated and joint venture companies are unsecured, trade-related, non-interest bearing and repayable on demand.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## For the Financial Year ended 31 March 2025

## 36 Sales in Advance of Carriage and Deferred Revenue (in $ million)

Sales in advance of carriage and deferred revenue are recognised as revenue when the Group fulfils its performance obligation under the contract with the customer. The significant changes in these liabilities during the year are as follows:

|                                                                                  | The Group   | The Group   | The Company   | The Company   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
|                                                                                  | FY2024/25   | FY2023/24   | FY2024/25     | FY2023/24     |
| Revenue recognised that was included in the balance at the beginning of the year |             |             |               |               |
| - Sales in advance of carriage                                                   | 3,873.2     | 3,733.2     | 3,487.9       | 3,377.4       |
| - Deferred revenue                                                               | 544.6       | 641.4       | 539.2         | 641.4         |

Deferred revenue relates to KrisFlyer and KrisPay miles expected to be redeemed. The Group expects the majority of these miles to be redeemed by the end of their validity dates.

All tickets sold at any given point of time have travel dates extending up to 12 months. As a result, the balance of the sales in advance of carriage liability represents activity that will typically be recognised in the next 12 months.

## 38 Capital Expenditure Commitments (in $ million)

The Group and the Company have commitments for capital expenditure. Such commitments aggregated $11,684.7 million (2024: $12,268.7 million) for the Group and $10,421.7 million (2024: $10,707.2 million) for the Company. The commitments relate principally to the acquisition of aircraft fleet and related equipment.

The increase in the Group's share of associated companies' commitments for capital expenditure is due to AI's aircraft order.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## For the Financial Year ended 31 March 2025

## 39 Leases (in $ million)

## (a) As lessee

## Aircraft

The Company leases three 777-300ERs, seven A350-900s, four 787-10s, four 737-800NGs, six 737-8s and five 777F freighters at fixed rental rates. The leases of two A380-800 were terminated during the year. The original lease terms of these aircraft range from three to 13 years.

For flexibility in fleet planning, most leases include extension options. The extension options provide for lease renewals up to a maximum of four years. In addition, leases for the A350-900s, 787-10s and 737-8s include early termination options that allow termination of the leases up to two years prior to original lease expiry. Sub-leasing is allowed under all the lease arrangements.

Scoot Pte. Ltd. ('Scoot') leases 14 A320-200s, four A320neos, nine A321neo, five E190-E2 and six 787s. The original lease terms on the aircraft are for five to 13 years. Certain aircraft leases confer on Scoot an option to purchase the related aircraft. Sub-leasing is allowed under all the lease arrangements, subject to certain terms and conditions stated in the agreements. Certain aircraft leases allow for lease extension/termination options for a period of three months to two years from original lease expiry. The lease term for certain aircraft leases were extended by two to three years.

Singapore Flying College ('SFC') leases two Piper Seminole (G1000) aircraft in Australia. The original lease terms on the aircraft are for a period of five years, with an option to renew. Both aircraft leases allow for lease extension/termination options for a period of up to three years from original lease expiry.

## Spare engines

The Company has lease agreements for six Trent 1000-J and six Trent TXWB-84 engines with fixed rental rates. The original lease terms for the Trent 1000-J and Trent TXWB-84 engines are 10 years with extension options of up to 36 months.

## Property and equipment

The  Group  has  entered  into  lease  agreements  for  office  and  computer  equipment,  leasehold  land  and buildings. These non-cancellable leases have lease terms of between one and 60 years.

## Extension/termination options

To the extent the future lease payments can be reliably estimated, the Group has determined that in relation to aircraft, should the extension options be exercised, it would result in an increase in lease liabilities of $431.0 million (2024: $452.4 million), while the exercise of the termination options would result in a decrease in lease liabilities of $245.3 million (2024: $229.7 million).

## 40 Contingent Liabilities (in $ million)

## (a) Cargo: Investigations by Competition Authorities and Civil Class Damages Actions

In 2006 and thereafter, SIA Cargo and the Company were among several airlines that received notice of investigations  by  competition  authorities  in  the  United  States,  European  Union,  Australia,  Canada,  New Zealand, South Africa, South Korea and Switzerland as to whether surcharges, rates or other competitive aspects of air cargo service were lawfully determined (the 'air cargo issues').

On 9 November 2010, the European Commission issued an adverse decision against 13 air cargo airlines, including SIA Cargo and the Company, in respect of fuel surcharges, security surcharges and commissions on surcharges. A fine of EUR74.8 million ($135.7 million) was imposed on SIA Cargo and the Company. SIA Cargo paid the fine in February 2011 in accordance with European Union laws. This amount was reflected as an exceptional item in the Group's accounts in FY2010/11. SIA Cargo and the Company filed an appeal to the European General Court seeking annulment of the decision. In December 2015, the European General Court annulled the decision of the European Commission in its entirety vis-à-vis SIA Cargo and the Company. In  February 2016, EUR76.4 million ($119.1 million) comprising the fine amount and returns thereon was refunded  to  SIA  Cargo.  This  refund  was  recognised  as  a  non-operating  item  in  the  Group's  FY2015/16 accounts. In March 2017, the European Commission re-adopted a decision in respect of the same case against the air cargo airlines, imposing a fine of EUR74.8 million ($111.8 million) against SIA Cargo and the Company. This amount was recognised as a non-operating item in the Group's accounts in FY2016/17. SIA Cargo and the Company have filed an appeal to the European General Court seeking annulment of the re-adopted decision. In March 2022, the European General Court has issued its decision, dismissing the appeal by SIA Cargo and the Company. In June 2022, SIA Cargo and the Company filed an appeal to the European Court of Justice against the decision of the European General Court.

In January 2014, the Swiss Competition Commission announced a fine against SIA Cargo and the Company of CHF1.7 million ($2.3 million) in respect of the air cargo issues. This amount was reflected as an exceptional item in the Group's accounts in FY2013/14. SIA Cargo and the Company have filed an appeal to the Swiss Federal Administrative Tribunal seeking annulment of the decision. In December 2022, the tribunal partially allowed the appeal, reducing the fine amount to CHF1.4 million ($2.1 million). The Company filed an appeal to the Swiss Federal Supreme Court against the decision of the Swiss Federal Administrative Tribunal. In April 2025, the Company was notified that the court had partially allowed the appeal, reducing the fine amount to CHF1.05 million ($1.6 million).

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## For the Financial Year ended 31 March 2025

## 40 Contingent Liabilities (in $ million) (continued)

## (a) Cargo: Investigations by Competition Authorities and Civil Class Damages Actions (continued)

The proceedings by competition authorities in the United States, South Korea, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand were resolved in previous financial periods.

After the investigations commenced, civil damage lawsuits were filed in the United States, Canada, Australia, South Korea,  England,  the  Netherlands,  Norway  and  Germany  by  private  parties  against  several  airlines, including SIA Cargo and the Company. Other lawsuits have been threatened by customers of SIA Cargo or shippers that purportedly contracted with SIA Cargo's customers.

In November 2023 and February 2024, without admitting any liability, SIA Cargo and the Company entered into a settlement with two out of the three claimant groups in the civil damages claim filed in the Netherlands.

Without admitting any liability, SIA Cargo and/or the Company have settled the civil damages claims in the United States, Canada, Australia, South Korea, England and Germany, as the case may be, to resolve all liabilities of SIA Cargo and/or the Company as concerns such lawsuits filed in the relevant jurisdictions.

In  addition,  without  admitting  any  liability,  in  2012,  2013  and  2015,  SIA  Cargo  reached  settlements  with certain customers to resolve all pending and potential future civil damage claims regarding the air cargo issues for those customers. The prior settlements have been reflected in the Group's financial statements in the previous financial years. The individual terms of all such settlements are required to be kept confidential.

Apart  from  the  civil  damages  claims  in  the  United  States,  Canada,  Australia,  South  Korea,  England  and Germany, the filed cases remain in their respective procedural stages and none have been tried thus far on their respective substantive legal merits.

Apart from the items recorded as non-operating items noted above, it is premature to make a provision in the financial statements for the other pending investigations, court proceedings, civil suits, or threatened claims as their respective outcomes are uncertain.

## (b) Passengers: Civil Class Actions

The Company and several other airlines have been named in a civil class action lawsuit in Canada alleging an unlawful agreement to fix surcharges and fares on transpacific flights. The case is currently in the procedural stage and has not been tried thus far on its substantive legal merits. As the lawsuit has neither been tried nor alleged damages quantified, it is premature to make a provision in the financial statements.

## 41 Financial Instruments (in $ million)

## Classification and fair values of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured on an ongoing basis either at fair value or at amortised cost. The material accounting policies in note 2 describe how the classes of financial instruments are measured, and how revenue and expenses, including fair value gains and losses, are recognised. The carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy are as per the following tables.

Financial assets and financial liabilities that are classified as measured at amortised cost with carrying amounts being a reasonable approximation of their fair values are not presented in these tables. These financial assets include trade debtors, deposits and other debtors, amounts owing by subsidiary companies and cash and bank balances. These financial liabilities include trade and other creditors, amounts owing to subsidiary companies and loans.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## For the Financial Year ended 31 March 2025

## 41 Financial Instruments (in $ million) (continued)

## Classification and fair values of financial instruments (continued)

## Financial instruments carried at fair value

The Group classifies fair value measurement using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:

- · Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
- · Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices)
- · Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability

There has been no transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 during the financial year.

## Determination of fair value

The fair values of the financial instruments are determined as follows:

- · Jet fuel swap contracts - mark-to-market valuations, adjusted for bilateral counterparty credit risks.
- · InterContinental  Exchange  ('ICE')  Brent  swap  and  Brent-MOPS  crack  swap  contracts  -  by  reference  to available market information and the marked-to-market values of these swap contracts, adjusted for bilateral counterparty credit risks. As the Group hedges with ICE Brent and Brent-MOPS crack contracts, the ICE Brent futures contract price and its differential relative to MOPS price are used as the mark-to-market prices.
- · Forward currency contracts - by reference to current forward prices for contracts with similar maturity profiles, adjusted for bilateral counterparty credit risks.
- · Interest rate swap contracts - by discounting the future cash flows of swap contracts at market interest rate, adjusted for bilateral counterparty credit risks.
- · Cross currency swap contracts - by reference to market prices for existing cash flow profiles pre-agreed with counterparties at trade inception, adjusted for bilateral counterparty credit risks.
- · Quoted investments - by reference to stock exchange quoted market bid prices at the close of business at the end of the reporting period. For investments where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques that are commonly used by market participants.
- · Other long-term receivables - by discounting expected future cash flows at market incremental lending rate for similar types of lending at the end of the reporting period.
- · Notes payable - by reference to stock exchange quoted market bid prices at the close of business at the end of the reporting period.
- · Convertible bonds - by reference to stock exchange quoted market bid prices at the close of business at the end of the reporting period.
- · Currency options - by reference to valuations provided by the Company's counterparties.

## For the Financial Year ended 31 March 2025

## 41 Financial Instruments (in $ million) (continued)

## Master netting or similar agreements

The Group enters into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association ('ISDA') master netting agreements. In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in  respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances - e.g., when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.

The above ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement of financial position. This is because they create a right of set-off of recognised amounts that is enforceable only following an event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparties. In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

The  Group  also  enters  into  netting  arrangements  with  International  Air  Transport  Association  ('IATA')  which  is enforceable in the normal course of operations and also following an event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparties. The Group settles these balances on a net basis during the normal course of operations.

The  following  table  sets  out  the  carrying  amounts  of  recognised  financial  instruments  that  are  subject  to  the above agreements.

## 42 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (in $ million)

The Group operates globally and generates revenue in various currencies. The Group's airline operations carry certain financial and commodity risks, including the effects of changes in jet fuel prices, foreign currency exchange rates,  interest  rates  and  the  market  value  of  its  investments.  The  Group's  overall  risk  management  approach  is to  moderate the effects of such volatility on its financial performance through the use of derivatives to hedge specific exposures.

As derivatives are used for the purpose of risk management, they do not expose the Group to market risk because gains and losses on the derivatives offset losses and gains on the matching asset, liability, revenues or expenses being hedged. Moreover, counterparty credit risk is generally restricted to any hedging gain from time to time, and not the principal amount hedged. Therefore, the possibility of a material loss arising in the event of non-performance by a counterparty is considered to be unlikely.

Financial risk  management policies are periodically reviewed and approved by the Board Executive Committee ('BEC').

## (a) Jet fuel price risk

The Group's earnings are affected by changes in the price of jet fuel. The Group's strategy for managing the risk on fuel price, as defined by the BEC, aims to provide the Group with protection against sudden and significant increases in jet fuel prices. In meeting these objectives, the fuel risk management programme allows  for  the  judicious  use  of  approved  instruments  such  as  swaps,  options  and  collars  with  approved counterparties and within approved credit limits to hedge approved range of anticipated jet fuel purchases over a specified time frame.

## Cash flow hedges

The  Group  manages  this  fuel  price  risk  by  using  jet  fuel  swap,  ICE  Brent  swap  and  Brent-MOPS  crack swap contracts.

The Group has applied cash flow hedge accounting to the derivatives which are considered to be highly effective hedging instruments. A net fair value loss before tax of $70.9 million (2024: gain before tax of $166.0 million), with a related deferred tax credit of $12.1 million (2024: deferred tax expense of $28.2 million), was included in the fair value reserve in respect of these contracts.

Following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a significant reduction in the Group's capacity and hence fuel consumption, compared to prior planned flight schedules. Where the occurrences of these forecasted  jet  fuel  purchases  are  no  longer  highly  probable,  hedge  accounting  has  been  discontinued. All discontinued hedges have matured in FY2024/25 and no gain (2024: gain of $57.3 million) previously recognised in profit or loss remained in the fair value reserve as at 31 March 2025.

## (a) Jet fuel price risk (continued)

The table below sets out the movements for fuel hedges:

| Change in fair value of hedging instrument | (181.8)     | 353.7       | (181.8)       | 353.7         |
| Change in fair value of hedged item        | 182.1       | (354.4)     | 182.1         | (354.4)       |

As at 31 March 2025, the Group had entered into Brent and MOPS hedges with maturities extending up to the fourth quarter of FY2029/30 that cover up to approximately 12.7% of the Group's projected annual fuel consumption, at an average price ranging from USD68 to USD91 per barrel. All the remaining sell swaps have matured in the fourth quarter of FY2024/25.

## Jet fuel price sensitivity analysis

The jet  fuel  price  risk  sensitivity  analysis  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  all  other  factors,  such  as  fuel surcharge and uplifted fuel volume, remain constant. Under this assumption, and excluding the effects of hedging, an increase in price of one USD per barrel of jet fuel affects the Group's and the Company's annual fuel costs by $54.3 million and $46.7 million (FY2023/24: $50.1 million and $42.6 million) respectively.

The fuel hedging sensitivity analysis is based on contracts that are outstanding as at the end of the reporting period and assumes that all jet fuel, Brent and crack hedges are highly effective. Under these assumptions, an increase or decrease in jet fuel prices, each by one USD per barrel, will have the before tax effects as set out in the table below.

## Sensitivity analysis on outstanding fuel hedging contracts:

## (b) Foreign currency risk

The Group is exposed to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations because of its foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses. For the financial year ended 31 March 2025, these accounted for 67.6% of total revenue (FY2023/24: 66.8%) and 52.9% of total operating expenses (FY2023/24: 54.3%). The Group's largest exposures are from United States Dollar, Euro, UK Sterling Pound, Australian Dollar, New Zealand Dollar, Japanese Yen, Indian Rupee, Hong Kong Dollar, Chinese Yuan and Indonesian Rupiah. The Group generates a surplus in all of these currencies, with the exception of USD. The deficit in USD is attributable to capital expenditure, fuel costs and aircraft leasing costs - all conventionally denominated and payable in USD.

The Group manages its foreign exchange exposure by a policy of matching, as far as possible, receipts and payments in each individual currency. Surpluses of convertible currencies are sold, as soon as practicable, for USD or SGD. The Group also uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of its future foreign exchange exposure. Such contracts provide for the Group to sell currencies at predetermined forward rates, buying either USD or SGD depending on forecast requirements, with settlement dates up to 24 months. The Group uses cross currency swap contracts to hedge USD bond liability and its coupon payments into SGD. The Group uses these currency hedging contracts purely as a hedging tool. It does not take positions in currencies with a view to making speculative gains from currency movements. The Group also uses deposits in foreign currencies to hedge a portion of the forecast USD capital expenditure in the next 24 months.

## Cash flow hedges

## a) Net operating and other exposures

The Group held cash flow hedges to manage net operating exposures to foreign currencies. As at 31 March 2025, the carrying amounts of these hedges consisted of $43.2 million (2024: $31.1 million) derivative assets and $16.9 million (2024: $14.4 million) derivative liabilities for the Group and the Company. During the financial year, the amount reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss (classified under 'Other operating expenses') is a gain of $14.6 million (2024: gain of $12.7 million). As at 31 March 2025, a net fair value gain of $2.3 million (2024: loss of $4.3 million), with $0.2 million deferred tax expense (2024: $0.6 million deferred tax credit), was included in the fair value reserve with respect to these contracts.

## Fair value hedges

The Group enters into fair value hedges to manage the exposure to USD-denominated aircraft residual value.  The  residual  values  of  aircraft  are  subject  to  foreign  currency  fluctuations  and  are  remeasured  to the prevailing exchange rates at the end of the reporting period. These underlying currency movements on aircraft are designated in a fair value hedge are included within 'Property, plant and equipment' in the statements of financial position. The hedging instrument is included within 'Lease liabilities'. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of both the hedged item and hedging instrument are offset within 'Other operating expenses' and no ineffectiveness arose on fair value hedges during the year.

## Foreign currency sensitivity analysis

The foreign currency risk sensitivity analysis is based on the assumption that all cash flow hedges are highly effective; hence, there will be no impact on profit before taxation from cash flow hedges.

The  following  table  details  the  sensitivity  of  a  1%  strengthening  of  SGD  against  the  respective  foreign currencies.  The  sensitivity  analysis  includes  only  outstanding  foreign  currency  hedging  contracts  and significant outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 1% change in foreign currency rates.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## For the Financial Year ended 31 March 2025

## 42 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (in $ million) (continued)

## (c) Interest rate risk

The Group's earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact such changes have on interest income and expense from short-term deposits and other interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities. The Group enters into interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate costs on its financial assets and liabilities, with the prior approval of the BEC or Boards of subsidiary companies.

## Cash flow hedges

The Group enters into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the interest rate exposure on underlying loans. As at 31 March 2025, the total nominal amount of these cash flow hedges was $2,755.1 million (2024: $3,293.0 million) with a hedged rate range of 0.34% to 2.92% (2024: 0.34% to 2.92%) for the Group and $2,599.1 million (2024: $3,089.0 million) with a hedged rate range of 0.34% to 2.86% (2024: 0.34% to 2.86%) for the Company.

The terms of the interest rate swap contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the loans and, accordingly, the fair value hedges are assessed to be highly effective. As at 31 March 2025, a net fair value gain of $100.5 million (2024: gain of $210.9 million) with related deferred tax expense of $17.1 million (2024: deferred tax expense of $35.7 million) was included in the fair value reserve in respect of these contracts.

## Interest rate sensitivity analysis

The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions:

- · Changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or finance charges of variable interest financial instruments.
- · Changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments and all interest rate hedges are expected to be highly effective.
- · Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period.

Under these assumptions, an increase or decrease in market interest rates of 10 basis points for all currencies in which the Group has derivative financial instruments and variable rate assets and liabilities at 31 March 2025 will have the effects as set out in the table below.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## For the Financial Year ended 31 March 2025

## 42 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (in $ million) (continued)

## (e) Liquidity risk

At  31  March  2025,  the  Group  had  at  its  disposal,  cash  and  short-term  deposits  amounting  to  $8,257.1 million (2024: $11,256.0 million). In addition, the Group had committed unsecured credit facilities of about $3,340.4 million (2024: $2,910.0 million) available for utilisation as at 31 March 2025. The Group also has a Medium Term Note Programme and Medium Term Bond Programme under which it may issue notes up to $12,000.0 million (2024: $12,000.0 million) and as of 31 March 2025, $7,325.5 million (2024: $7,010.9 million) remained unutilised. Under these uncommitted Programmes, notes issued by the Company may have varying maturities as contracted with the relevant financial institutions.

The Group's holdings of cash and short-term deposits are expected to be sufficient to cover the cost of all firm aircraft deliveries due in the next financial year. It is expected that any shortfall would be met by bank borrowings or public market funding. Due to the necessity to plan aircraft orders well in advance of delivery, it is not economical for the Group to have committed funding in place at present for all outstanding orders, many of which relate to aircraft which will not be delivered for several years. The Group's policies in this regard are in line with the funding policies of other major airlines.

The maturity profile of the financial liabilities of the Group and the Company is as follows. The amounts disclosed  in  the  table  are  the  contractual  undiscounted  cash  flows.  Balances  due  within  12  months approximate their carrying amounts as the impact of discounting is insignificant.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## For the Financial Year ended 31 March 2025

## 42 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (in $ million) (continued)

## (f) Credit risk

The  Group  has  an  independent  Group  Debts  Review  Committee  to  review  the  follow  up  actions  on outstanding receivables monthly. On a day-to-day basis, the respective Finance divisions have the primary responsibility for measuring and managing specific risk exposures.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for the Group and the Company is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statements of financial position.

There  are  no  significant  concentrations  of  credit  risk  other  than  from  counterparties  of  cash  and  bank balances and derivative instruments, where transactions are limited to financial institutions possessing high credit quality and hence the risk of default is low.

The sale of passenger and cargo transportation is largely achieved through IATA accredited sales agents. The credit risk of such sales agents is relatively small owing to broad diversification. In specific instances, the contract may require special collateral.

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the contract, receivables and payables among airlines are settled either bilaterally or via the IATA Clearing House. Receivables and payables are generally netted and settled at weekly intervals, which lead to a clear reduction in the risk of default.

For all other service relationships, depending on the nature and scope of the services rendered, collateral is required, credit reports or references are obtained and use is made of historical data from previous business relations, especially with regard to payment behaviour, in order to avoid non-performance.

Collateral requested from debtors include bank guarantees, cash-in-lieu of deposit and security deposits.

The Group determines concentrations of credit risk by monitoring the industry, country and credit rating of its counterparties. The table below shows an analysis of credit risk exposures of balances that exceed 5% of the financial assets of the Group and the Company as at 31 March:

## 44 Capital Management (in $ million)

The primary objective of the management of the Company's capital structure is to maintain an efficient mix of debt and equity in order to achieve a low cost of capital, while taking into account the desirability of retaining financial flexibility to pursue business opportunities and adequate access to liquidity to mitigate the effect of unforeseen events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, on cash flows.

The  Directors  regularly  review  the  Company's  capital  structure  and  make  adjustments  to  reflect  economic conditions, business strategies and future commitments.

The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is total debt divided by total capital.

Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

During the financial year ended 31 March 2025, no significant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes relating to the management of the Company's capital structure.

## NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING SINGAPORE AIRLINES LIMITED

(Incorporated in the Republic of Singapore) Company Registration No. 197200078R

## Explanatory notes

- 1. In relation to Ordinary Resolution Nos. 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d), Mr Peter Seah Lim Huat will, upon re-election, (i) continue to serve as Chairman of the Board and the Board Executive Committee and a member of the Board Safety and Risk Committee and (ii) step down as Chairman, but remain as a member, of the Board Compensation and Industrial Relations Committee and the Board Nominating Committee. Mr Goh Choon Phong will, upon re-election, continue to serve as a member of the Board Executive Committee and the Customer Experience, Technology and Sustainability Committee. Mr David John Gledhill will, upon re-election, continue to serve as a member of the Board Safety and Risk Committee and the Customer Experience, Technology and Sustainability Committee. Mr Yeoh Oon Jin will, upon re-election, continue to serve as Chairman of the Board Audit Committee and a member of the Board Executive Committee. As at the date of this Notice, Mr Seah is considered an independent Director but will, subject to his re-election as a Director at this Annual General Meeting, be re-designated as a non-independent Director pursuant to Rule 210(5)(d)(iv) of the Listing Manual of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (the ' SGX-ST ') with effect from the conclusion of this Annual General Meeting. Mr Gledhill and Mr Yeoh are considered independent Directors. Mr Goh, who is the Chief Executive Officer, is considered a non-independent Director. Please refer to the section on Additional Information on Directors Seeking Re-Election in the Annual Report FY2024/25 for information relating to each of these Directors, as set out in Appendix 7.4.1 of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST.
- 2. Ordinary Resolution No. 4, if passed, will facilitate the payment of up to S$2,600,000 as Directors' fees during the financial year in which the fees are incurred, that is, during the financial year ending 31 March 2026 (' FY2025/26 ') (up to S$2,600,000 for the previous financial year). The amount of Directors' fees is computed based on the fee structure for non-executive Directors for FY2025/26 and takes into account, among others, the anticipated number of Board and Board Committee meetings for FY2025/26, assuming full attendance in person by all of the non-executive Directors. The amount also caters for any additional unscheduled Board or Board Committee meetings and/or the formation of additional Board Committees. The amount also includes transport and travel benefits to be provided to the non-executive Directors. In the event that the amount proposed is insufficient, approval will be sought at the next Annual General Meeting in year 2026 (' 2026 AGM ') before payments are made to Directors for the shortfall. Mr Goh Choon Phong, being the Chief Executive Officer, does not receive any Director's fees.

The current intention is that the Directors' fees for non-executive Directors for FY2025/26 will comprise a cash component and a share component, with approximately 30% being paid out in the form of awards under the SIA Restricted Share Plan 2024. Any such award would typically consist of the grant of fully paid shares outright with no performance or vesting conditions attached, but with a selling moratorium of one year. Non-executive Directors would eventually be required to hold shares (including shares obtained by other means) worth a minimum of the annual basic retainer fees (currently S$90,000) as the shares paid out to them as part of their remuneration in lieu of cash accumulate over time.

The cash component of the Directors' fees for FY2025/26 is intended to be paid quarterly in arrears. The share component of the Directors' fees for FY2025/26 is intended to be paid after the 2026 AGM has been held. The actual number of shares to be awarded to each non-executive Director holding office at the time of the payment is intended to be determined by reference to the volume weighted average price of a share on the SGX-ST over the 10 trading days from (and including) the day on which the shares are first quoted ex-dividend after the 2026 AGM (or, if no final dividend is proposed at the 2026 AGM, or the resolution to approve any such final dividend is not approved at the 2026 AGM, over the 10 trading days immediately following the date of the 2026 AGM). The number of shares to be awarded will be rounded down to the nearest hundred and any residual balance will be settled in cash. A non-executive Director who steps down before the payment of the share component will receive all of his Directors' fees for FY2025/26 (calculated on a pro-rated basis, where applicable) in cash.

- 3. Ordinary Resolution No. 6, if passed, will empower the Directors to issue shares, make or grant instruments convertible into shares and to issue shares pursuant to such instruments. The number of shares which the Directors may issue under this Ordinary Resolution will not exceed 50% of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings), with a sub-limit of 5% for issues other than on a pro rata basis. The 5% sub-limit for nonpro rata issues is lower than the 20% sub-limit allowed under the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST. For the purpose of determining the aggregate number of shares which may be issued, the percentage of issued shares shall be based on the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) at the time this Ordinary Resolution is passed, after adjusting for (a) new shares arising from the conversion or exercise of any convertible instruments or share options or vesting of share awards which were issued and are outstanding at the time this Ordinary Resolution is passed; and (b) any subsequent bonus issue or consolidation or subdivision of shares. For the avoidance of doubt, shareholders' approval will be required for any consolidation or subdivision of shares. As at 29 May 2025, the Company had 6,437,526 treasury shares and no subsidiary holdings.
- 4. Ordinary Resolution No. 7, if passed, will empower the Directors to grant awards, and allot and issue ordinary shares of the Company, pursuant to the SIA Performance Share Plan 2024 (the ' SIA PSP 2024 ') and the SIA Restricted Share Plan 2024 (the ' SIA RSP 2024 ').
- The SIA PSP 2024 and the SIA RSP 2024 were adopted at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 29 July 2024. The total number of ordinary shares which may be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the SIA PSP 2024 and the SIA RSP 2024 (whether in the form of ordinary shares or in the form of cash in lieu of ordinary shares) shall not exceed 5% of the total number of issued ordinary shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) from time to time. In addition, Ordinary Resolution No. 7 will also provide that the total number of ordinary shares under awards to be granted pursuant to the SIA PSP 2024 and the SIA RSP 2024 from this Annual General Meeting to the next Annual General Meeting (the ' Relevant Year ') shall not exceed 0.5% of the total number of issued ordinary shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) from time to time (the ' Yearly Limit '), provided that if the Yearly Limit is not fully utilised during the Relevant Year, any unutilised portion of the Yearly Limit may be used by the Directors to make grants of awards under the SIA PSP 2024 and the SIA RSP 2024 in subsequent years, for the duration of the SIA PSP 2024 and the SIA RSP 2024 respectively.
- 5. Ordinary Resolution No. 8, if passed, will renew the mandate to allow the Company, its subsidiaries and associated companies that are entities at risk (as that term is used in Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST) or any of them, to enter into certain interested person transactions with certain classes of interested persons as described in the Appendix to the Letter to Shareholders dated 25 June 2025 (the ' Letter '). The authority will, unless revoked or varied by the Company in general meeting, continue in force until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company. Please refer to the Letter for more details.
- 6. Ordinary Resolution No. 9, if passed, will renew the mandate to allow the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire its issued ordinary shares, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Resolution.
- The Company may use internal or external sources of funds to finance the purchase or acquisition of its ordinary shares. The amount of financing required for the Company to purchase or acquire its ordinary shares, and the impact on the Company's financial position, cannot be ascertained as at the date of this Notice as these will depend on the number of ordinary shares purchased or acquired, the price at which such ordinary shares were purchased or acquired and whether the ordinary shares purchased or acquired are held in treasury or cancelled.

The financial effects of the purchase or acquisition of such ordinary shares by the Company pursuant to the proposed Share Buy Back Mandate on the audited financial statements of the Company and the Company and its subsidiaries for the financial year ended 31 March 2025, based on certain assumptions, are set out in paragraph 3.7 of the Letter.

Please refer to the Letter for more details.

- 1. If the member has shares entered against his/her/its name in the Depository Register (maintained by The Central Depository (Pte) Limited), he/she/it should insert that number of shares. If the member has shares registered in his/her/its name in the Register of Members (maintained by or on behalf of the Company), he/she/it should insert that number of shares. If the member has shares entered against his/her/its name in the Depository Register and shares registered in his/her/its name in the Register of Members, he/she/it should insert the aggregate number of shares. If no number is inserted, this instrument appointing a proxy(ies) will be deemed to relate to all the shares held by the member.
- 2. (a) A member who is not a relevant intermediary is entitled to appoint not more than two proxies to attend, speak and vote at the Annual General Meeting. Where such member's instrument appointing a proxy(ies) appoints more than one proxy, the proportion of the shareholding concerned to be represented by each proxy shall be specified in the instrument.
- (b) A member who is a relevant intermediary is entitled to appoint more than two proxies to attend, speak and vote at the Annual General Meeting, but each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by such member. Where such member's instrument appointing a proxy(ies) appoints more than two proxies, the number and class of shares in relation to which each proxy has been appointed shall be specified in the instrument.

' Relevant intermediary ' has the meaning ascribed to it in Section 181 of the Companies Act 1967.

A member who wishes to appoint a proxy(ies) must complete the instrument appointing a proxy(ies), before submitting it in the manner set out below.

- 3. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. A member may choose to appoint the Chairman of the Meeting as his/her/its proxy.

- (a) if submitted personally or by post, be lodged with the Company's Share Registrar, Boardroom Corporate &amp; Advisory Services Pte. Ltd., at 1 Harbourfront Avenue, #14-07 Keppel Bay Tower, Singapore 098632; or

- and in each case, must be lodged or received (as the case may be) not less than 72 hours before the time appointed for holding the Annual General Meeting.
- 5. Completion and submission of the instrument appointing a proxy(ies) shall not preclude a member from attending, speaking and voting at the Annual General Meeting if he/she so wishes.

- 6. The instrument appointing a proxy(ies) must be under the hand of the appointor or of his/her attorney duly authorised in writing. Where the instrument appointing a proxy(ies) is executed by a corporation, it must be executed either under its seal or under the hand of an officer or attorney duly authorised. Where an instrument appointing a proxy(ies) is signed on behalf of the appointor by an attorney, the letter or power of attorney or a duly certified copy thereof must (failing previous registration with the Company), if the instrument is submitted personally or by post, be lodged with the instrument or, if the instrument is submitted electronically via email, be emailed with the instrument, failing which the instrument may be treated as invalid.
- 7. A corporation which is a member may also authorise by resolution of its directors or other governing body such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at the Annual General Meeting in accordance with Section 179 of the Companies Act 1967.
- 8. The Company shall be entitled to reject an instrument appointing a proxy(ies) if it is incomplete, improperly completed, illegible or where the true intentions of the appointor are not ascertainable from the instructions of the appointor specified in the instrument appointing a proxy(ies) (including any related attachment). In addition, in the case of members whose shares are entered against their names in the Depository Register, the Company may reject any instrument appointing a proxy(ies) lodged or submitted if such members are not shown to have shares entered against their names in the Depository Register 72 hours before the time appointed for holding the Annual General Meeting, as certified by The Central Depository (Pte) Limited to the Company.
